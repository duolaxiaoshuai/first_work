Recent clinical advance suggests a  reversibility of liver fibrosis, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms  underlying NASH resolution remain unclarified. Here, using a murine diet-induced  NASH and the subsequent resolution model, we demonstrate direct roles of CD8+  tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (CD8+ Trm) cells in resolving liver fibrosis.  Single-cell transcriptome analysis and FACS analysis revealed CD69+CD103-CD8+  Trm cell enrichment in NASH resolution livers. The reduction of liver CD8+ Trm  cells, maintained by tissue IL-15, significantly delayed fibrosis resolution,  while adoptive transfer of these cells protected mice from fibrosis progression.  During resolution, CD8+ Trm cells attracted hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in a  CCR5-dependent manner, and predisposed activated HSCs to FasL-Fas-mediated  apoptosis. Histological assessment of patients with NASH revealed CD69+CD8+ Trm  abundance in fibrotic areas, further supporting their roles in humans. These  results highlight the undefined role of liver CD8+ Trm in fibrosis resolution.","Yuzo Koda,Toshiaki Teratani,Po-Sung Chu,Yuya Hagihara,Yohei Mikami,Yosuke Harada,Hanako Tsujikawa,Kentaro Miyamoto,Takahiro Suzuki,Nobuhito Taniki,Tomohisa Sujino,Michiie Sakamoto,Takanori Kanai,Nobuhiro Nakamoto",-,"Adoptive Transfer;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Animals;Apoptosis / immunology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes / immunology*;Disease Models, Animal;Disease Progression;Female;Hepatic Stellate Cells / immunology;Hepatic Stellate Cells / pathology*;Humans;Immunologic Memory;Interleukin-15 / immunology;Liver Cirrhosis / immunology*;Liver Cirrhosis / pathology*;Liver Cirrhosis / therapy;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Middle Aged;Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease / immunology*;Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease / pathology*;Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease / therapy;Receptors, CCR5 / immunology;Young Adult","Humans,Mice,Inbred C57BL,Immunologic Memory,Adoptive Transfer,Aged,80 and over,Young Adult,Middle Aged,Mice,Disease Models,Male,Disease Progression,Animals,Female,Adult,Aged,Receptors,CCR5,Interleukin-15,Hepatic Stellate Cells,Apoptosis,CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes,Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,Liver Cirrhosi"

Currently, lack of data underlying how the human host  interacts with viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limits effective  therapeutic intervention. We introduce Viral-Track, a computational method that  globally scans unmapped single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for the  presence of viral RNA, enabling transcriptional cell sorting of infected versus  bystander cells. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of Viral-Track  to systematically detect viruses from multiple models of infection, including  hepatitis B virus, in an unsupervised manner. Applying Viral-Track to  bronchoalveloar-lavage samples from severe and mild COVID-19 patients reveals a  dramatic impact of the virus on the immune system of severe patients compared to  mild cases. Viral-Track detects an unexpected co-infection of the human  metapneumovirus, present mainly in monocytes perturbed in type-I interferon  (IFN)-signaling. Viral-Track provides a robust technology for dissecting the  mechanisms of viral-infection and pathology.","Pierre Bost,Amir Giladi,Yang Liu,Yanis Bendjelal,Gang Xu,Eyal David,Ronnie Blecher-Gonen,Merav Cohen,Chiara Medaglia,Hanjie Li,Aleksandra Deczkowska,Shuye Zhang,Benno Schwikowski,Zheng Zhang,Ido Amit",COVID-19; Viral-Track; single-cell RNA-seq; virus host interactions.,"Animals;Betacoronavirus / isolation &amp; purification;COVID-19;Coinfection / immunology;Coronavirus Infections / immunology;Coronavirus Infections / pathology;Coronavirus Infections / physiopathology*;Coronavirus Infections / virology;Host-Pathogen Interactions*;Humans;Interferons / immunology;Lung / pathology;Pandemics;Pneumonia, Viral / immunology;Pneumonia, Viral / pathology;Pneumonia, Viral / physiopathology*;Pneumonia, Viral / virology;SARS-CoV-2;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sequence Analysis, RNA;Severity of Illness Index;Single-Cell Analysis;Software*","Severity of Illness Index,SARS-CoV-2,Pandemics,purification,Host-Pathogen Interactions,Sensitivity and Specificity,COVID-19,Humans,Animals,Software,Coinfection,Interferons,Coronavirus Infections,Pneumonia,Viral,Betacoronavirus,Lun"

However, little is  known about the molecular profile and fate of these two subsets after the  elimination of chronic antigen stimulation by direct-acting antiviral (DAA)  therapy. Here, we report a progenitor-progeny relationship between memory-like  and terminally exhausted HCV-specific CD8+ T cells via an intermediate subset.  Single-cell transcriptomics implicated that memory-like cells are maintained and  terminally exhausted cells are lost after DAA-mediated cure, resulting in a  memory polarization of the overall HCV-specific CD8+ T cell response. However,  an exhausted core signature of memory-like CD8+ T cells was still detectable,  including, to a smaller extent, in HCV-specific CD8+ T cells targeting variant  epitopes. These results identify a molecular signature of T cell exhaustion that  is maintained as a chronic scar in HCV-specific CD8+ T cells even after the  cessation of chronic antigen stimulation.","Nina Hensel,Zuguang Gu,Sagar,Dominik Wieland,Katharina Jechow,Janine Kemming,Sian Llewellyn-Lacey,Emma Gostick,Oezlem Sogukpinar,Florian Emmerich,David A Price,Bertram Bengsch,Tobias Boettler,Christoph Neumann-Haefelin,Roland Eils,Christian Conrad,Ralf Bartenschlager,Dominic Grün,Naveed Ishaque,Robert Thimme,Maike Hofmann",-,"Antigens, Viral / immunology;Antiviral Agents / therapeutic use;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes / immunology*;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes / metabolism;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes / virology;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Regulatory Networks;Hepacivirus / drug effects;Hepacivirus / immunology*;Hepatitis C, Chronic / drug therapy;Hepatitis C, Chronic / genetics;Hepatitis C, Chronic / immunology*;Hepatitis C, Chronic / virology;Host-Pathogen Interactions;Humans;Immunologic Memory / genetics*;Phenotype;Remission Induction;Single-Cell Analysis;Transcriptome*;Treatment Outcome","Gene Regulatory Networks,Remission Induction,Treatment Outcome,Phenotype,Humans,Host-Pathogen Interactions,Hepacivirus,Antigens,Viral,Immunologic Memory,Hepatitis C,Chronic,CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes,Antiviral Agent"

Chronic  necro-inflammation is a critical factor in development of NASH, yet the cellular  and molecular mechanisms of immune dysregulation in this disease are poorly  understood. Here, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we comprehensively  profiled the immune composition of the mouse liver during NASH. We identified a  significant pathology-associated increase in hepatic conventional dendritic  cells (cDCs) and further defined their source as NASH-induced boost in cycling  of cDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Analysis of blood and liver from patients  on the NAFLD/NASH spectrum showed that type 1 cDCs (cDC1) were more abundant and  activated in disease. Sequencing of physically interacting cDC-T cell pairs from  liver-draining lymph nodes revealed that cDCs in NASH promote inflammatory T  cell reprogramming, previously associated with NASH worsening. Finally,  depletion of cDC1 in XCR1DTA mice or using anti-XCL1-blocking antibody  attenuated liver pathology in NASH mouse models. Overall, our study provides a  comprehensive characterization of cDC biology in NASH and identifies XCR1+ cDC1  as an important driver of liver pathology.","Aleksandra Deczkowska,Eyal David,Pierluigi Ramadori,Dominik Pfister,Michal Safran,Baoguo Li,Amir Giladi,Diego Adhemar Jaitin,Oren Barboy,Merav Cohen,Ido Yofe,Chamutal Gur,Shir Shlomi-Loubaton,Sandrine Henri,Yousuf Suhail,Mengjie Qiu,Shing Kam,Hila Hermon,Eylon Lahat,Gil Ben Yakov,Oranit Cohen-Ezra,Yana Davidov,Mariya Likhter,David Goitein,Susanne Roth,Achim Weber,Bernard Malissen,Assaf Weiner,Ziv Ben-Ari,Mathias Heikenwälder,Eran Elinav,Ido Amit",-,"Animals;Bone Marrow Cells / immunology;Bone Marrow Cells / pathology;Cellular Reprogramming / genetics;Cellular Reprogramming / immunology;Dendritic Cells / immunology*;Dendritic Cells / pathology;Diet, High-Fat / adverse effects;Disease Models, Animal;Fatty Liver / genetics;Fatty Liver / immunology*;Fatty Liver / pathology;Female;Humans;Liver / immunology;Liver / pathology;Lymph Nodes / immunology;Lymph Nodes / pathology;Male;Mice;Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease / genetics;Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease / immunology*;Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease / pathology;Receptors, Chemokine / genetics*;Receptors, Chemokine / immunology;T-Lymphocytes / immunology;T-Lymphocytes / pathology","Mice,Disease Models,Male,Humans,Animals,Female,Fatty Liver,Dendritic Cells,Cellular Reprogramming,Receptors,Chemokine,Diet,High-Fat,Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,Liver,T-Lymphocytes,Bone Marrow Cells,Lymph Node"

It is  difficult to uncouple transcriptional plasticity of these transformed cells from  genetic changes that evolve in primary tumors or secondary metastases. Profiling  of single cells is also problematic if the required sample dissociation  activates injury-like signaling and reprogramming. Here we defined cell-state  heterogeneities in situ through laser capture microdissection-based 10-cell  transcriptomics coupled with stochastic-profiling fluctuation analysis. In  labeled cells from a small-cell lung cancer mouse model initiated by  neuroendocrine deletion of Rb1-Trp53, variations in transcript abundance  revealed cell-to-cell differences in regulatory state in vitro and in vivo.  Fluctuating transcripts in spheroid culture were partly shared among  Rb1-Trp53-null models, and heterogeneities increased considerably when cells  were delivered intravenously to colonize the liver. Colonization of  immunocompromised animals drove a fractional appearance of alveolar type II-like  markers and poised cells for paracrine stimulation from immune cells and  hepatocytes. Immunocompetency further exaggerated the fragmentation of tumor  states in the liver, yielding mixed stromal signatures evident in bulk  sequencing from autochthonous tumors and metastases. Dozens of transcript  heterogeneities recurred irrespective of biological context; their mapped  orthologs brought together observations of murine and human small-cell lung  cancer. Candidate heterogeneities recurrent in the liver also stratified primary  human tumors into discrete groups not readily explained by molecular subtype but  with prognostic relevance. These data suggest that heterotypic interactions in  the liver and lung are an accelerant for intratumor heterogeneity in small-cell  lung cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that the single-cell  regulatory heterogeneity of small-cell lung cancer becomes increasingly  elaborate in the liver, a common metastatic site for the disease.See related  articles by Singh and colleagues, p. 1840 and Sutcliffe and colleagues, p. 1868.","Dylan L Schaff,Shambhavi Singh,Kee-Beom Kim,Matthew D Sutcliffe,Kwon-Sik Park,Kevin A Janes",-,"Animals;Breast Neoplasms*;Female;Humans;Lung;Lung Neoplasms* / genetics;Mice;Neoplasm Recurrence, Local;Small Cell Lung Carcinoma* / genetics;Tumor Microenvironment","Tumor Microenvironment,Mice,Neoplasm Recurrence,Local,Breast Neoplasms,Humans,Animals,Female,Lung,Lung Neoplasms,Small Cell Lung Carcinom"

Here we interrogated functions of hepatic stellate  cells (HSCs), the main source of liver fibroblasts3, during  hepatocarcinogenesis. Genetic depletion, activation or inhibition of HSCs in  mouse models of HCC revealed their overall tumour-promoting role. HSCs were  enriched in the preneoplastic environment, where they closely interacted with  hepatocytes and modulated hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating hepatocyte  proliferation and death. Analyses of mouse and human HSC subpopulations by  single-cell RNA sequencing together with genetic ablation of  subpopulation-enriched mediators revealed dual functions of HSCs in  hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatocyte growth factor, enriched in quiescent and  cytokine-producing HSCs, protected against hepatocyte death and HCC development.  By contrast, type I collagen, enriched in activated myofibroblastic HSCs,  promoted proliferation and tumour development through increased stiffness and  TAZ activation in pretumoural hepatocytes and through activation of discoidin  domain receptor 1 in established tumours. An increased HSC imbalance between  cytokine-producing HSCs and myofibroblastic HSCs during liver disease  progression was associated with increased HCC risk in patients. In summary, the  dynamic shift in HSC subpopulations and their mediators during chronic liver  disease is associated with a switch from HCC protection to HCC promotion.","Aveline Filliol,Yoshinobu Saito,Ajay Nair,Dianne H Dapito,Le-Xing Yu,Aashreya Ravichandra,Sonakshi Bhattacharjee,Silvia Affo,Naoto Fujiwara,Hua Su,Qiuyan Sun,Thomas M Savage,John R Wilson-Kanamori,Jorge M Caviglia,LiKang Chin,Dongning Chen,Xiaobo Wang,Stefano Caruso,Jin Ku Kang,Amit Dipak Amin,Sebastian Wallace,Ross Dobie,Deqi Yin,Oscar M Rodriguez-Fiallos,Chuan Yin,Adam Mehal,Benjamin Izar,Richard A Friedman,Rebecca G Wells,Utpal B Pajvani,Yujin Hoshida,Helen E Remotti,Nicholas Arpaia,Jessica Zucman-Rossi,Michael Karin,Neil C Henderson,Ira Tabas,Robert F Schwabe",-,"Animals;Carcinogenesis* / pathology;Carcinoma, Hepatocellular* / pathology;Cell Proliferation;Collagen Type I / metabolism;Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 / metabolism;Disease Progression;Hepatic Stellate Cells* / metabolism;Hepatic Stellate Cells* / pathology;Hepatocyte Growth Factor / metabolism;Hepatocytes;Humans;Liver Cirrhosis / complications;Liver Neoplasms* / pathology;Mice;Myofibroblasts / pathology","Disease Progression,Cell Proliferation,Mice,Hepatocytes,Humans,Animals,Carcinogenesis,Collagen Type I,Carcinoma,Hepatocellular,Liver Neoplasms,Myofibroblasts,Hepatic Stellate Cells,Hepatocyte Growth Factor,Liver Cirrhosis,Discoidin Domain Receptor "

The histological finding of dendritic cell expansion in portal fields of  patients with PSC prompted us to investigate the role of dendritic cells in  orchestrating the immune response to bile duct injury. METHODS: Dendritic cell numbers and subtypes were determined in different mouse  models of cholangitis by flow cytometry based on lineage-imprinted markers.  Findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy of murine livers, and  liver samples from patients with PSC were compared to control samples from  bariatric surgery patients. Using genetic tools, selected dendritic cell subsets  were depleted in murine cholangitis. The dendritic cell response to bile duct  injury was determined by single-cell transcriptomics. RESULTS: Cholangitis mouse models were characterised by selective intrahepatic  expansion of type 2 conventional dendritic cells, whereas plasmacytoid and type  1 conventional dendritic cells were not expanded. Expansion of type 2  conventional dendritic cells in human PSC lesions was confirmed by histology.  Depletion studies revealed a proinflammatory role of type 2 conventional  dendritic cells. Single-cell transcriptomics confirmed inflammatory maturation  of the intrahepatic type 2 conventional dendritic cells and identified dendritic  cell-derived inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSIONS: Cholangitis is characterised by intrahepatic expansion and  inflammatory maturation of type 2 conventional dendritic cells in response to  biliary injury. Therefore, type 2 conventional dendritic cells and their  inflammatory mediators might be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment  of PSC. LAY SUMMARY: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an inflammatory liver  disease of the bile ducts for which there is no effective treatment. Herein, we  show that the inflammatory immune response to bile duct injury is organised by a  specific subtype of immune cell called conventional type 2 dendritic cells. Our  findings suggest that this cell subtype and the inflammatory molecules it  produces are potential therapeutic targets for PSC.","Anna-Lena Müller,Christian Casar,Max Preti,Daria Krzikalla,Cornelia Gottwick,Pia Averhoff,Philip Rosenstiel,Mathias Gelderblom,Marcus Altfeld,Ansgar W Lohse,Silja Steinmann,Marcial Sebode,Jenny Krause,Dorothee Schwinge,Christoph Schramm,Antonella Carambia,Johannes Herkel",Cholangitis; Th17; bile duct; dendritic cells; inflammation.,,Cholangitis; Th17; bile duct; dendritic cells; inflammation.

Studies of hepatoblastoma that focus exclusively on tumor cells  demonstrate sparse somatic mutations and a common cell of origin, the  hepatoblast, across patients. In contrast to the homogeneity these studies would  suggest, hepatoblastoma tumors have a high degree of heterogeneity that can  portend poor prognosis. In this study, we use single-cell transcriptomic  techniques to analyze resected human pediatric hepatoblastoma specimens, and  identify five hepatoblastoma tumor signatures that may account for the tumor  heterogeneity observed in this disease. Notably, patient-derived hepatoblastoma  spheroid cultures predict differential responses to treatment based on the  transcriptomic signature of each tumor, suggesting a path forward for precision  oncology for these tumors. In this work, we define hepatoblastoma tumor  heterogeneity with single-cell resolution and demonstrate that patient-derived  spheroids can be used to evaluate responses to chemotherapy.","Hanbing Song,Simon Bucher,Katherine Rosenberg,Margaret Tsui,Deviana Burhan,Daniel Hoffman,Soo-Jin Cho,Arun Rangaswami,Marcus Breese,Stanley Leung,María V Pons Ventura,E Alejandro Sweet-Cordero,Franklin W Huang,Amar Nijagal,Bruce Wang",-,"Chemotherapy, Adjuvant;Child;Hepatoblastoma* / drug therapy;Hepatoblastoma* / genetics;Humans;Infant;Liver Neoplasms* / drug therapy;Liver Neoplasms* / genetics;Liver Neoplasms* / pathology;Precision Medicine;Single-Cell Analysis","Chemotherapy,Adjuvant,Infant,Precision Medicine,Child,Humans,Hepatoblastoma,Liver Neoplasm"

Here, we generated a  p16-CreERT2-tdTomato mouse model to analyze the in vivo characteristics of  p16high cells at a single-cell level. We found tdTomato-positive p16high cells  detectable in all organs, which were enriched with age. We also found that these  cells failed to proliferate and had half-lives ranging from 2.6 to 4.2 months,  depending on the tissue examined. Single-cell transcriptomics in the liver and  kidneys revealed that p16high cells were present in various cell types, though  most dominant in hepatic endothelium and in renal proximal and distal tubule  epithelia, and that these cells exhibited heterogeneous senescence-associated  phenotypes. Further, elimination of p16high cells ameliorated nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis-related hepatic lipidosis and immune cell infiltration.

Here, we performed single-cell analyses for  autologous samples from liver metastasized colorectal cancer to disentangle  factors shaping TME. By aligning CD45+ cells across different tissues, we  classified exhausted CD8+ T cells (Texs) and activated regulatory T cells as  M-type, whose phenotypes were associated with the malignancy, while natural  killer and mucosal-associated invariant T cells were defined as N-type, whose  phenotypes were associated with the niche. T cell receptor sharing between Texs  in primary and metastatic tumors implicated the presence of common peripheral  non-exhausted precursors. For myeloid cells, a subset of dendritic cells (DC3s)  and SPP1+ macrophages were M-type, and the latter were predominant in liver  metastasis, indicating its pro-metastasis role. Our analyses bridge immune  phenotypes of primary and metastatic tumors, thereby helping to understand the  tumor-specific contexture and identify the pro-metastasis components.","Yedan Liu,Qiming Zhang,Baocai Xing,Nan Luo,Ranran Gao,Kezhuo Yu,Xueda Hu,Zhaode Bu,Jirun Peng,Xianwen Ren,Zemin Zhang",CRC liver metastasis; scRNA-seq; tumor infiltrating; tumor microenvironment.,CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Colorectal Neoplasms* / pathology;Humans;Immunotherapy;Liver Neoplasms* / genetics;Tumor Microenvironment,"Humans,Tumor Microenvironment,CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes,Immunotherapy,Liver Neoplasms,Colorectal Neoplasm"
