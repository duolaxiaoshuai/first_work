PRO000000308,liver_paper,E-MTAB-11821,XCR1(+) type 1 conventional dendritic cells drive liver pathology in  non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  (NASH) are prevalent liver conditions that underlie the development of  life-threatening cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic  necro-inflammation is a critical factor in development of NASH, yet the cellular  and molecular mechanisms of immune dysregulation in this disease are poorly  understood. Here, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we comprehensively  profiled the immune composition of the mouse liver during NASH. We identified a  significant pathology-associated increase in hepatic conventional dendritic  cells (cDCs) and further defined their source as NASH-induced boost in cycling  of cDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Analysis of blood and liver from patients  on the NAFLD/NASH spectrum showed that type 1 cDCs (cDC1) were more abundant and  activated in disease. Sequencing of physically interacting cDC-T cell pairs from  liver-draining lymph nodes revealed that cDCs in NASH promote inflammatory T  cell reprogramming, previously associated with NASH worsening. Finally,  depletion of cDC1 in XCR1DTA mice or using anti-XCL1-blocking antibody  attenuated liver pathology in NASH mouse models. Overall, our study provides a  comprehensive characterization of cDC biology in NASH and identifies XCR1+ cDC1  as an important driver of liver pathology.",,disease,E-MTAB-11821,,,XCR1(+) type 1 conventional dendritic cells drive liver pathology in  non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.,Nature medicine,10.1038/s41591-021-01344-3,35798133,"Aleksandra Deczkowska,Eyal David,Pierluigi Ramadori,Dominik Pfister,Michal Safran,Baoguo Li,Amir Giladi,Diego Adhemar Jaitin,Oren Barboy,Merav Cohen,Ido Yofe,Chamutal Gur,Shir Shlomi-Loubaton,Sandrine Henri,Yousuf Suhail,Mengjie Qiu,Shing Kam,Hila Hermon,Eylon Lahat,Gil Ben Yakov,Oranit Cohen-Ezra,Yana Davidov,Mariya Likhter,David Goitein,Susanne Roth,Achim Weber,Bernard Malissen,Assaf Weiner,Ziv Ben-Ari,Mathias Heikenwälder,Eran Elinav,Ido Amit","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  (NASH) are prevalent liver conditions that underlie the development of  life-threatening cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer.

The histological finding of dendritic cell expansion in portal fields of  patients with PSC prompted us to investigate the role of dendritic cells in  orchestrating the immune response to bile duct injury. METHODS: Dendritic cell numbers and subtypes were determined in different mouse  models of cholangitis by flow cytometry based on lineage-imprinted markers.  Findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy of murine livers, and  liver samples from patients with PSC were compared to control samples from  bariatric surgery patients. Using genetic tools, selected dendritic cell subsets  were depleted in murine cholangitis. The dendritic cell response to bile duct  injury was determined by single-cell transcriptomics. RESULTS: Cholangitis mouse models were characterised by selective intrahepatic  expansion of type 2 conventional dendritic cells, whereas plasmacytoid and type  1 conventional dendritic cells were not expanded. Expansion of type 2  conventional dendritic cells in human PSC lesions was confirmed by histology.  Depletion studies revealed a proinflammatory role of type 2 conventional  dendritic cells. Single-cell transcriptomics confirmed inflammatory maturation  of the intrahepatic type 2 conventional dendritic cells and identified dendritic  cell-derived inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSIONS: Cholangitis is characterised by intrahepatic expansion and  inflammatory maturation of type 2 conventional dendritic cells in response to  biliary injury.

Herein, we aimed to determine what drives tumor cell evolution by performing single-cell transcriptomic analysis.Methods: We analyzed 46 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) biopsies from 37 patients enrolled in interventional studies at the NIH Clinical Center, with 16 biopsies collected before and after treatment from 7 patients. We developed a novel machine learning-based consensus clustering approach to track cellular states of 57,000 malignant and non-malignant cells including tumor cell transcriptome-based functional clonality analysis. We determined tumor cell relationships using RNA velocity and reverse graph embedding. We also studied longitudinal samples from 4 patients to determine tumor cellular state and its evolution. We validated our findings in bulk transcriptomic data from 488 patients with HCC and 277 patients with iCCA.Results: Using transcriptomic clusters as a surrogate for functional clonality, we observed an increase in tumor cell state heterogeneity which was tightly linked to patient prognosis. Furthermore, increased functional clonality was accompanied by a polarized immune cell landscape which included an increase in pre-exhausted T cells. We found that SPP1 expression was tightly associated with tumor cell evolution and microenvironmental reprogramming. Finally, we developed a user-friendly online interface as a knowledge base for a single-cell atlas of liver cancer.Conclusions: Our study offers insight into the collective behavior of tumor cell communities in liver cancer as well as potential drivers of tumor evolution in response to therapy.Lay summary: Intratumor molecular heterogeneity is a key feature of tumorigenesis that is linked to treatment failure and patient prognosis.

We determined tumor cell relationships using RNA velocity and reverse graph embedding. We also studied longitudinal samples from 4 patients to determine tumor cellular state and its evolution. We validated our findings in bulk transcriptomic data from 488 patients with HCC and 277 patients with iCCA.Results: Using transcriptomic clusters as a surrogate for functional clonality, we observed an increase in tumor cell state heterogeneity which was tightly linked to patient prognosis. Furthermore, increased functional clonality was accompanied by a polarized immune cell landscape which included an increase in pre-exhausted T cells. We found that SPP1 expression was tightly associated with tumor cell evolution and microenvironmental reprogramming. Finally, we developed a user-friendly online interface as a knowledge base for a single-cell atlas of liver cancer.Conclusions: Our study offers insight into the collective behavior of tumor cell communities in liver cancer as well as potential drivers of tumor evolution in response to therapy.Lay summary: Intratumor molecular heterogeneity is a key feature of tumorigenesis that is linked to treatment failure and patient prognosis. In this study, we present a single-cell atlas of liver tumors from patients treated with immunotherapy and describe intratumoral cell states and their hierarchical relationship. We suggest osteopontin, encoded by the gene SPP1, as a candidate regulator of tumor evolution in response to treatment.","Biopsy / methods;Biopsy / statistics &amp; numerical data;Carcinoma, Hepatocellular / drug therapy*;Carcinoma, Hepatocellular / physiopathology;Cholangiocarcinoma / drug therapy;Cholangiocarcinoma / physiopathology;Humans;Immunotherapy / methods;Immunotherapy / standards*;Immunotherapy / statistics &amp; numerical data;Liver Neoplasms / drug therapy;Liver Neoplasms / pathology;Neoplastic Cells, Circulating / classification;Neoplastic Cells, Circulating / drug effects*;Neoplastic Cells, Circulating / ultrastructure*",Functional clonality; Liver cancer; Osteopontin; Single cell; T cells; Tumor cell state; Tumor evolution; Tumor microenvironments; Tumor transcriptomic heterogeneity.,"Humans,numerical data,Liver Neoplasms,Neoplastic Cells,Circulating,Cholangiocarcinoma,Immunotherapy,Carcinoma,Hepatocellular,Biops",,2021 Dec,published,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05289-6,available
