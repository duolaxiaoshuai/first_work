1,Construction of a human cell landscape at single-cell level,"Single-cell analysis is a valuable tool for dissecting cellular heterogeneity in complex systems1. However, a comprehensive single-cell atlas has not been achieved for humans. Here we use single-cell mRNA sequencing to determine the cell-type composition of all major human organs and construct a scheme for the human cell landscape (HCL). We have uncovered a single-cell hierarchy for many tissues that have not been well characterized. We established a 'single-cell HCL analysis' pipeline that helps to define human cell identity. Finally, we performed a single-cell comparative analysis of landscapes from human and mouse to identify conserved genetic networks. We found that stem and progenitor cells exhibit strong transcriptomic stochasticity, whereas differentiated cells are more distinct. Our results provide a useful resource for the study of human biology.",cell_atlas,Pubmed,,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134355, https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/HCL_DGE_Data/7235471",HCL,1
2,Mapping the Mouse Cell Atlas by Microwell-Seq,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies are poised to reshape the current cell-type classification system. However, a transcriptome-based single-cell atlas has not been achieved for complex mammalian systems. Here, we developed Microwell-seq, a high-throughput and low-cost scRNA-seq platform using simple, inexpensive devices. Using Microwell-seq, we analyzed more than 400,000 single cells covering all of the major mouse organs and constructed a basic scheme for a mouse cell atlas (MCA). We reveal a single-cell hierarchy for many tissues that have not been well characterized previously. We built a web-based ""single-cell MCA analysis"" pipeline that accurately defines cell types based on single-cell digital expression. Our study demonstrates the wide applicability of the Microwell-seq technology and MCA resource.",cell_atlas,Pubmed,,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE108097, https://figshare.com/s/865e694ad06d5857db4b",MCA,1
3,Census of Immune Cells,"Diverse cells of the immune system maintain and protect tissue function, integrity, and homeostasis upon changes in functional demands and diverse perturbations. Recent advances such as massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing and sophisticated computational methods help shed new light on this complexity. This immune cell census aims to profile up to 2M immunocytes, the first tranche of this is currently available. With computational methods optimized to a massive scale, we can readily identify cell types and markers, as well as the process of hematopoietic differentiation. The high quality and comprehensive reference map is provided as an open community resource for understanding human health and disease.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-4/result,E-HCAD-4,1
4,A single cell Arabidopsis root atlas reveals developmental trajectories in wild type and cell identity mutants,"In all multicellular organisms, transcriptional networks orchestrate organ development. The Arabidopsis root, with its simple structure and indeterminate growth, is an ideal model for investigating the spatiotemporal transcriptional signatures underlying developmental trajectories. To map gene expression dynamics across root cell types and developmental time, we built a comprehensive, organ-scale atlas at single-cell resolution. In addition to estimating developmental progressions in pseudotime, we employed the mathematical concept of optimal transport to infer developmental trajectories and identify their underlying regulators. To demonstrate the utility of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for two key transcriptional regulators at single-cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow. We report transcriptomic and in vivo evidence for tissue trans-differentiation underlying a mixed cell identity phenotype in scarecrow. Our results support the atlas as a rich community resource for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate spatiotemporal organ development.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-152766/result,E-GEOD-152766,0
5,"Human fetal liver, skin and kidney single cell transcriptome data","Definitive haematopoiesis in the fetal liver supports self-renewal and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) but remains poorly defined in humans. Here, using single-cell transcriptome profiling of approximately 140,000 liver and 74,000 skin, kidney and yolk sac cells, we identify the repertoire of human blood and immune cells during development. We infer differentiation trajectories from HSC/MPPs and evaluate the influence of the tissue microenvironment on blood and immune cell development. We reveal physiological erythropoiesis in fetal skin and the presence of mast cells, natural killer and innate lymphoid cell precursors in the yolk sac. We demonstrate a shift in the haemopoietic composition of fetal liver during gestation away from being predominantly erythroid, accompanied by a parallel change in differentiation potential of HSC/MPPs, which we functionally validate. Our integrated map of fetal liver haematopoiesis provides a blueprint for the study of paediatric blood and immune disorders, and a reference for harnessing the therapeutic potential of HSC/MPPs.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7407/result,E-MTAB-7407,1
6,Ischaemic sensitivity of human tissue by single cell RNA seq,"Background: The Human Cell Atlas is a large international collaborative effort to map all cell types of the human body. Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design.
Results: This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from â‰¥ 5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific.
Conclusions: In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing.",cell_atlas;methodology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-1/result,E-HCAD-1,1
7,Gene expression profiling of SARS-CoV-1/2 infected human cell lines at single-cell level,"To identify human genes and cellular pathways influencing SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed genome-wide measurements of different aspects of gene expression at the bulk and single-cell level. Different human cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and harvested at different time points. Gene expression profiling was measured using bulk and single-cell polyA RNA-sequencing, smallRNA sequencing, and totalRNA sequencing. This experiment contains the single-cell expression data.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-53/result,E-CURD-53,1
8,Single cell RNAseq of mouse olfactory bulb reveals cellular heterogeneity and activity dependent molecular census of adult-born neurons,"Cellular heterogeneity within the mammalian brain poses a challenge toward understanding its complex functions. Within the olfactory bulb, odor information is processed by subtypes of inhibitory interneurons whose heterogeneity and functionality are influenced by ongoing adult neurogenesis. To investigate this cellular heterogeneity and better understand adult-born neuron development, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling to reveal diverse and transcriptionally distinct neuronal and nonneuronal cell types. We also analyzed molecular changes during adult-born interneuron maturation and uncovered developmental programs within their gene expression profiles. Finally, we identified that distinct neuronal subtypes are differentially affected by sensory experience. Together, these data provide a transcriptome-based foundation for investigating subtype-specific neuronal function in the olfactory bulb (OB), charting the molecular profiles that arise during the maturation and integration of adult-born neurons and how they dynamically change in an activity-dependent manner.",neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-121891/result,E-GEOD-121891,1
9,Immune landscape of viral- and carcinogen-derived head and neck cancer,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) arises through exposure to environmental carcinogens or malignant transformation by human papillomavirus (HPV). Here, we assessed the transcriptional profiles of 131,224 single cells from peripheral and intra-tumoral immune populations from patients with HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC and healthy donors. Immune cells within tumors of HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC displayed a spectrum of transcriptional signatures, with helper CD4+ T cells and B cells being relatively divergent and CD8+ T cells and CD4+ regulatory T cells being relatively similar. Transcriptional results were contextualized through multispectral immunofluorescence analyses and evaluating putative cell-cell communication based on spatial proximity. These analyses defined a gene expression signature associated with CD4+ T follicular helper cells that is associated with longer progression-free survival in HNSCC patients. The datasets and analytical approaches herein provide a resource for the further study of the impact of immune cells on viral- and carcinogen-induced cancers.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-139324/result,E-GEOD-139324,1
10,scRNA-seq of human fetal lung primary tissues and cell cultures derived from fetal bud tip progenitors under dual SMAD treatment,"Bud tip progenitor cells give rise to all murine lung epithelial lineages and have been described in the developing human lung; however, the mechanisms controlling human bud tip differentiation into specific lineages are unclear. Here, we used homogeneous human bud tip organoid cultures and identified SMAD signaling as a key regulator of the bud tip-to-airway transition. SMAD induction led to the differentiation of airway-like organoids possessing functional basal cells capable of clonal expansion and multilineage differentiation. To benchmark in vitro-derived organoids, we developed a single-cell mRNA sequencing atlas of the human lung from 11.5 to 21 weeks of development, which revealed high degrees of similarity between the in vitro-derived and in vivo airway. Together, this work sheds light on human airway differentiation in vitro and provides a single-cell atlas of the developing human lung.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8221/result,E-MTAB-8221,1
11,"A cell atlas of human thymic development defines T cell repertoire formation, human thymic gene expression data","The thymus provides a nurturing environment for the differentiation and selection of T cells, a process orchestrated by their interaction with multiple thymic cell types. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cell census of the human thymus across the life span and to reconstruct T cell differentiation trajectories and T cell receptor (TCR) recombination kinetics. Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8Î±Î±+ T cell populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states. In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment. Taken together, our data provide a comprehensive atlas of the human thymus across the life span with new insights into human T cell development.",cell_atlas;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-79/result,E-CURD-79,1
12,A Cellular Atlas of Pitx2-Dependent Cardiac Development,"During early human pregnancy the uterine mucosa transforms into the decidua, into which the fetal placenta implants and where placental trophoblast cells intermingle and communicate with maternal cells. Trophoblast-decidual interactions underlie common diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and stillbirth. Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal blood and decidual cells. The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of ligand-receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type specificity of cell-cell communication via these molecular interactions. Our data identify many regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or adaptive immune responses in this environment. Our single-cell atlas of the maternal-fetal interface reveals the cellular organization of the decidua and placenta, and the interactions that are critical for placentation and reproductive success.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-17/result,E-HCAD-17,1

14,Single-cell analysis of Crohn's disease lesions identifies a pathogenic cellular module associated with resistance to anti-TNF therapy,"Clinical benefits of cytokine blockade in ileal Crohn's disease (iCD) are limited to a subset of patients. Here, we applied single-cell technologies to iCD lesions to address whether cellular heterogeneity contributes to treatment resistance. We found that a subset of patients expressed a unique cellular module in inflamed tissues that consisted of IgG plasma cells, inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes, activated T cells, and stromal cells, which we named the GIMATS module. Analysis of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identified a distinct network connectivity that likely drives the GIMATS module. Strikingly, the GIMATS module was also present in a subset of patients in four independent iCD cohorts (n = 441), and its presence at diagnosis correlated with failure to achieve durable corticosteroid-free remission upon anti-TNF therapy. These results emphasize the limitations of current diagnostic assays and the potential for single-cell mapping tools to identify novel biomarkers of treatment response and tailored therapeutic opportunities.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-46/result,E-CURD-46,1
15,Single-cell RNA-seq of mouse developing spinal cord,"The coordinated spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in the vertebrate neural tube determines the identity of neural progenitors and the function and physiology of the neurons they generate. Progress has been made deciphering the gene regulatory programmes that are responsible for this process; however, the complexity of the tissue has hampered the systematic analysis of the network and the underlying mechanisms. To address this, we used single cell mRNA sequencing to profile cervical and thoracic regions of the developing mouse neural tube between embryonic days 9.5-13.5. We confirmed that the data accurately recapitulates neural tube development, allowing us to identify new markers for specific progenitor and neuronal populations. In addition, the analysis highlighted a previously underappreciated temporal component to the mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity, and revealed common features in the sequence of transcriptional events that lead to the differentiation of specific neuronal subtypes. Together, the data offer insight into the mechanisms that are responsible for neuronal specification and provide a compendium of gene expression for classifying spinal cord cell types that will support future studies of neural tube development, function and disease.",neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7320/result,E-MTAB-7320,1
16,Immune cell profiling of COVID-19 patients in the recovery stage by single-cell sequencing,"Age-associated changes in immune cells have been linked to an increased risk for infection. However, a global and detailed characterization of the changes that human circulating immune cells undergo with age is lacking. Here, we combined scRNA-seq, mass cytometry and scATAC-seq to compare immune cell types in peripheral blood collected from young and old subjects and patients with COVID-19. We found that the immune cell landscape was reprogrammed with age and was characterized by T cell polarization from naive and memory cells to effector, cytotoxic, exhausted and regulatory cells, along with increased late natural killer cells, age-associated B cells, inflammatory monocytes and age-associated dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of genes, which were implicated in coronavirus susceptibility, was upregulated in a cell subtype-specific manner with age. Notably, COVID-19 promoted age-induced immune cell polarization and gene expression related to inflammation and cellular senescence. Therefore, these findings suggest that a dysregulated immune system and increased gene expression associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility may at least partially account for COVID-19 vulnerability in the elderly.",disease;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-55/result,E-CURD-55,1
17,A single-cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to severe COVID-19,"There is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has infected more than three million people worldwide. Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease and 5% of patients require intensive care. Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes, lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, we provide a cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to severe COVID-19.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-150728/result,E-GEOD-150728,1
18,Single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse germ cells,"Male gametes are generated through a specialised differentiation pathway involving a series of developmental transitions that are poorly characterised at the molecular level. Here, we use droplet-based single-cell RNA-Sequencing to profile spermatogenesis in adult animals and at multiple stages during juvenile development. By exploiting the first wave of spermatogenesis, we both precisely stage germ cell development and enrich for rare somatic cell-types and spermatogonia. To capture the full complexity of spermatogenesis including cells that have low transcriptional activity, we apply a statistical tool that identifies previously uncharacterised populations of leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes. Focusing on post-meiotic events, we characterise the temporal dynamics of X chromosome re-activation and profile the associated chromatin state using CUT&RUN. This identifies a set of genes strongly repressed by H3K9me3 in spermatocytes, which then undergo extensive chromatin remodelling post-meiosis, thus acquiring an active chromatin state and spermatid-specific expression.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6946/result,E-MTAB-6946,1
19,Single-cell RNA sequencing of the human biliary tree,"Organoid technology holds great promise for regenerative medicine but has not yet been applied to humans. We address this challenge using cholangiocyte organoids in the context of cholangiopathies, which represent a key reason for liver transplantation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that primary human cholangiocytes display transcriptional diversity that is lost in organoid culture. However, cholangiocyte organoids remain plastic and resume their in vivo signatures when transplanted back in the biliary tree. We then utilize a model of cell engraftment in human livers undergoing ex vivo normothermic perfusion to demonstrate that this property allows extrahepatic organoids to repair human intrahepatic ducts after transplantation. Our results provide proof of principle that cholangiocyte organoids can be used to repair human biliary epithelium.",disease;developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8495/result,E-MTAB-8495,1
20,A single-cell reference map of transcriptional states for human blood and tissue T cell activation,"Human T cells coordinate adaptive immunity in diverse anatomic compartments through production of cytokines and effector molecules, but it is unclear how tissue site influences T cell persistence and function. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of >50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-8/result,E-HCAD-8,1
21,Immunophenotyping of COVID-19 and Influenza Underscores the Association of Type I IFN Response in Severe COVID-19,"Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), some patients suffer from severe COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation. To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly up-regulation of the TNF/IL-1å°¾-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response co-existed with the TNF/IL-1å°¾-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19. Interestingly, we documented type I IFN-driven inflammatory features in patients with severe influenza as well. Based on this, we propose that the type I IFN response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating inflammation in severe COVID-19.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-149689/result,E-GEOD-149689,1

We single-cell RNA (scRNA)-sequenced 56,771 endothelial cells from human/mouse (peri)-tumoral lung and cultured human lung TECs, and detected 17 known and 16 previously unrecognized phenotypes, including TECs putatively regulating immune surveillance. We resolved the canonical tip TECs into a known migratory tip and a putative basement-membrane remodeling breach phenotype. Tip TEC signatures correlated with patient survival, and tip/breach TECs were most sensitive to vascular endothelial growth factor blockade. Only tip TECs were congruent across species/models and shared conserved markers. Integrated analysis of the scRNA-sequenced data with orthogonal multi-omics and meta-analysis data across different human tumors, validated by functional analysis, identified collagen modification as a candidate angiogenic pathway.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6308/result,E-MTAB-6308,1
23,"10x single cell gene expression of T cells from the blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue in psoriatic arthritis patients","Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a debilitating immune-mediated inflammatory arthritis of unknown pathogenesis commonly affecting patients with skin psoriasis. Here we use complementary single-cell approaches to study leukocytes from PsA joints. Mass cytometry demonstrates a 3-fold expansion of memory CD8 T cells in the joints of PsA patients compared to peripheral blood. Meanwhile, droplet-based and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of paired T cell receptor alpha and beta chain sequences show pronounced CD8 T cell clonal expansions within the joints. Transcriptome analyses find these expanded synovial CD8 T cells to express cycling, activation, tissue-homing and tissue residency markers. T cell receptor sequence comparison between patients identifies clonal convergence. Finally, chemokine receptor CXCR3 is upregulated in the expanded synovial CD8 T cells, while two CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, are elevated in PsA synovial fluid. Our data thus provide a quantitative molecular insight into the cellular immune landscape of psoriatic arthritis.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-85/result,E-CURD-85,1
24,Myocardial infarction time series single cell RNA-Seq,"Cardiac ischemia leads to the loss of myocardial tissue and the activation of a repair process that culminates in the formation of a scar whose structural characteristics dictate propensity to favorable healing or detrimental cardiac wall rupture. To elucidate the cellular processes underlying scar formation, here we perform unbiased single-cell mRNA sequencing of interstitial cells isolated from infarcted mouse hearts carrying a genetic tracer that labels epicardial-derived cells. Sixteen interstitial cell clusters are revealed, five of which were of epicardial origin. Focusing on stromal cells, we define 11 sub-clusters, including diverse cell states of epicardial- and endocardial-derived fibroblasts. Comparing transcript profiles from post-infarction hearts in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ inbred mice, which displays a marked divergence in the frequency of cardiac rupture, uncovers an early increase in activated myofibroblasts, enhanced collagen deposition, and persistent acute phase response in 129S1/SvImJ mouse hearts, defining a crucial time window of pathological remodeling that predicts disease outcome.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7895/result,E-MTAB-7895,1

We use single-cell RNA sequencing to define the cellular taxonomy of the Arabidopsis vegetative shoot apex at the transcriptome level. We find that the shoot apex is composed of highly heterogeneous cells, which can be partitioned into 7 broad populations with 23 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. We delineate cell-cycle continuums and developmental trajectories of epidermal cells, vascular tissue, and leaf mesophyll cells and infer transcription factors and gene expression signatures associated with cell fate decisions. Integrative analysis of shoot and root apical cell populations further reveals common and distinct features of epidermal and vascular tissues. Our results, thus, offer a valuable resource for investigating the basic principles underlying cell division and differentiation in plants at single-cell resolution.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-83/result,E-CURD-83,0
26,Single-cell RNA-seq of nasal cavity mucosa cells of mice stimulated with interferon alpha,"There is pressing urgency to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-52/result,E-CURD-52,1

The liver-resident immune cells (LrICs) determine the immune properties, but the unique composition and heterogeneity of these cells are incompletely understood. Here, we dissect the diversity of LrICs by a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling using the unbiased single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). A total of 70, 706 of CD45+immune cells from the paired liver perfusion, spleen and peripheral blood as references were profiled. We identified more than 30 discrete cell populations comprising 13 of T and NK cell, 7 of B cell, 4 of plasma cell, and 8 of myeloid cell subsets in human liver and donor-paired spleen and blood, and characterized their tissue distribution, gene expression and functional modules. Especially, four of CXCR6+T and NK cell subsets were found to be present preferentially in the liver, where they manifested heterogeneity, distinct function and prominent homeostatic proliferation. We propose a universal category system of T and NK cells based on distinct chemokine receptors, confirmed subsequently by phenotype, transcriptional factors and functionality. We also identified adaptive changes by the spleen and liver-derived monocyte and macrophage populations. Finally, we give a global glimpse on B cell and plasma cell subsets in human spleen and liver. We, therefore, reveal the heterogeneity and functional diversity of LrICs in human. This study presents comprehensively the landscape of LrICs and will enable further study on their roles in various human diseases.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-32/result,E-HCAD-32,1

Here we report the transcriptional profiles of 116,312 single cells from mouse embryos collected at nine sequential time points ranging from 6.5 to 8.5 days post-fertilization. We construct a molecular map of cellular differentiation from pluripotency towards all major embryonic lineages, and explore the complex events involved in the convergence of visceral and primitive streak-derived endoderm. Furthermore, we use single-cell profiling to show that Tal1-/-chimeric embryos display defects in early mesoderm diversification, and we thus demonstrate how combining temporal and transcriptional information can illuminate gene function. Together, this comprehensive delineation of mammalian cell differentiation trajectories in vivo represents a baseline for understanding the effects of gene mutations during development, as well as a roadmap for the optimization of in vitro differentiation protocols for regenerative medicine.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7325/result,E-MTAB-7325,1

To understand this cross-talk, we analyzed the transcriptome of 91,103 unsorted single cells from 23 Korean and 6 Belgian patients. Cancer cells displayed transcriptional features reminiscent of normal differentiation programs, and genetic alterations that apparently fostered immunosuppressive microenvironments directed by regulatory T cells, myofibroblasts and myeloid cells.

30,Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals dynamic cell populations and differential gene expression patterns in control and aneurysmal human aortic tissue,"Background:Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is caused by the progressive weakening and dilatation of the aortic wall and can lead to aortic dissection, rupture, and other life-threatening complications. To improve our understanding of ATAA pathogenesis, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the cellular composition of the ascending aortic wall and to identify molecular alterations in each cell population of human ATAA tissues.Methods:We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of ascending aortic tissues from 11 study participants, including 8 patients with ATAA (4 women and 4 men) and 3 control subjects (2 women and 1 man). Cells extracted from aortic tissue were analyzed and categorized with single-cell RNA sequencing data to perform cluster identification. ATAA-related changes were then examined by comparing the proportions of each cell type and the gene expression profiles between ATAA and control tissues. We also examined which genes may be critical for ATAA by performing the integrative analysis of our single-cell RNA sequencing data with publicly available data from genome-wide association studies.Results:We identified 11 major cell types in human ascending aortic tissue; the high-resolution reclustering of these cells further divided them into 40 subtypes. Multiple subtypes were observed for smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes, suggesting that these cells have multiple functional populations in the aortic wall. In general, ATAA tissues had fewer nonimmune cells and more immune cells, especially T lymphocytes, than control tissues did. Differential gene expression data suggested the presence of extensive mitochondrial dysfunction in ATAA tissues. In addition, integrative analysis of our single-cell RNA sequencing data with public genome-wide association study data and promoter capture Hi-C data suggested that the erythroblast transformation-specific related gene(ERG) exerts an important role in maintaining normal aortic wall function.Conclusions:Our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the cellular composition of the ascending aortic wall and reveals how the gene expression landscape is altered in human ATAA tissue. The information from this study makes important contributions to our understanding of ATAA formation and progression.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-36/result,E-HCAD-36,1
31,A single-cell atlas of lymphocyte adaptive immune repertoires and transcriptomes reveals age-related differences in convalescent COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 disease outcome is highly dependent on adaptive immunity from T and B lymphocytes, which play a critical role in the control, clearance and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is limited knowledge on the composition of the T and B cell immune receptor repertoires [T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs)] and transcriptomes in convalescent COVID-19 patients of different age groups. Here, we utilize single-cell sequencing (scSeq) of lymphocyte immune repertoires and transcriptomes to quantitatively profile the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients of varying age. We discovered highly expanded T and B cells in multiple patients, with the most expanded clonotypes coming from the effector CD8+ T cell population. Highly expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones show elevated markers of cytotoxicity (CD8: PRF1, GZMH, GNLY; CD4: GZMA), whereas clonally expanded B cells show markers of transition into the plasma cell state and activation across patients. By comparing young and old convalescent COVID-19 patients (mean ages = 31 and 66.8 years, respectively), we found that clonally expanded B cells in young patients were predominantly of the IgA isotype and their BCRs had incurred higher levels of somatic hypermutation than elderly patients. In conclusion, our scSeq analysis defines the adaptive immune repertoire and transcriptome in convalescent COVID-19 patients and shows important age-related differences implicated in immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",disease;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-77/result,E-CURD-77,1
32,Single-cell RNA sequencing of developing maize ears facilitates functional analysis and trait candidate gene discovery,"Crop productivity depends on activity of meristems that produce optimized plant architectures, including that of the maize ear. A comprehensive understanding of development requires insight into the full diversity of cell types and developmental domains and the gene networks required to specify them. Until now, these were identified primarily by morphology and insights from classical genetics, which are limited by genetic redundancy and pleiotropy. Here, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of 12,525 single cells from developing maize ears. The resulting developmental atlas provides a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) map of an inflorescence. We validated our results by mRNA in situ hybridization and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) RNA-seq, and we show how these data may facilitate genetic studies by predicting genetic redundancy, integrating transcriptional networks, and identifying candidate genes associated with crop yield traits.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-51/result,E-ENAD-51,0

These data represent a new resource for cell biology, revealing gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and allowing for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from distinct anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most tissues: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3â€™-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis, enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.

34,Neonatal and adult human testis defined at the single-cell level,"Spermatogenesis has been intensely studied in rodents but remains poorly understood in humans. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze human testes. Clustering analysis of neonatal testes reveals several cell subsets, including cell populations with characteristics of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). In adult testes, we identify four undifferentiated spermatogonia (SPG) clusters, each of which expresses specific marker genes. We identify protein markers for the most primitive SPG state, allowing us to purify this likely SSC-enriched cell subset. We map the timeline of male germ cell development from PGCs through fetal germ cells to differentiating adult SPG stages. We also define somatic cell subsets in both neonatal and adult testes and trace their developmental trajectories. Our data provide a blueprint of the developing human male germline and supporting somatic cells. The PGC-like and SSC markers are candidates to be used for SSC therapy to treat infertility.",disease;developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-124263/result,E-GEOD-124263,1
35,Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of Arabidopsis roots,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used extensively to study cell-specific gene expression in animals, but it has not been widely applied to plants. Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics platform for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-cell transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root cells. We find that all major tissues and developmental stages are represented in this single-cell transcriptome population. Further, distinct subpopulations and rare cell types, including putative quiescent center cells, were identified. A focused analysis of root epidermal cell transcriptomes defined developmental trajectories for individual cells progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair cell differentiation. In addition, single-cell transcriptomes were obtained from root epidermis mutants, enabling a comparative analysis of gene expression at single-cell resolution and providing an unprecedented view of the impact of the mutated genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-cell resolution.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-123013/result,E-GEOD-123013,0
36,A single cell transcriptome atlas of myeloid blood cell lineages in Drosophila [scRNA-seq],"The Drosophila lymph gland, the larval hematopoietic organ comprised of prohemocytes and mature hemocytes, has been a valuable model for understanding mechanisms underlying hematopoiesis and immunity. Three types of mature hemocytes have been characterized in the lymph gland: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells, which are analogous to vertebrate myeloid cells, yet molecular underpinnings of the lymph gland hemocytes have been less investigated. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to comprehensively analyze heterogeneity of developing hemocytes in the lymph gland, and discover previously undescribed hemocyte types including adipohemocytes, stem-like prohemocytes, and intermediate prohemocytes. Additionally, we identify the developmental trajectory of hemocytes during normal development as well as the emergence of the lamellocyte lineage following active cellular immunity caused by wasp infestation. Finally, we establish similarities and differences between embryonically derived- and larval lymph gland hemocytes. Altogether, our study provides detailed insights into the hemocyte development and cellular immune responses at single-cell resolution.",developmental_biology;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-141273/result,E-GEOD-141273,0

However, a comprehensive characterization of this biological process based on single-cell transcriptome analysis has not yet been reported. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing on 12 844 individual cells from the cotyledons of 5-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings. We identified 11 cell clusters corresponding mostly to cells at specific stomatal developmental stages using a series of marker genes. Comparative analysis of genes with the highest variable expression among these cell clusters revealed transcriptional networks that regulate development from meristemoid mother cells to guard mother cells. Examination of the developmental dynamics of marker genes via pseudo-time analysis revealed potential interactions between these genes. Collectively, our study opens the door for understanding how the identified novel marker genes participate in the regulation of stomatal lineage cell development.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-49/result,E-ENAD-49,0
38,Non-neuronal expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory system suggests mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated anosmia (scRNA-seq: olfactory mucosa),"Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.",disease;neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-151346/result,E-GEOD-151346,1

However, a comprehensive understanding of this interactive cell community is lacking. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of the total non-CM fraction and enriched (Pdgfra-GFP+) fibroblast lineage cells from murine hearts at days 3 and 7 post-sham or myocardial infarction (MI) surgery. Clustering of >30,000 single cells identified >30 populations representing nine cell lineages, including a previously undescribed fibroblast lineage trajectory present in both sham and MI hearts leading to a uniquely activated cell state defined in part by a strong anti-WNT transcriptome signature. We also uncovered novel myofibroblast subtypes expressing either pro-fibrotic or anti-fibrotic signatures. Our data highlight non-linear dynamics in myeloid and fibroblast lineages after cardiac injury, and provide an entry point for deeper analysis of cardiac homeostasis, inflammation, fibrosis, repair and regeneration.",disease;developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7376/result,E-MTAB-7376,1
40,Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of Murine Endothelial Cells,"The heterogeneity of endothelial cells (ECs) across tissues remains incompletely inventoried. We constructed an atlas of >32,000 single-EC transcriptomes from 11 mouse tissues and identified 78 EC subclusters, including Aqp7+intestinal capillaries and angiogenic ECs in healthy tissues. ECs from brain/testis, liver/spleen, small intestine/colon, and skeletal muscle/heart pairwise expressed partially overlapping marker genes. Arterial, venous, and lymphatic ECs shared more markers in more tissues than did heterogeneous capillary ECs. ECs from different vascular beds (arteries, capillaries, veins, lymphatics) exhibited transcriptome similarity across tissues, but the tissue (rather than the vessel) type contributed to the EC heterogeneity. Metabolic transcriptome analysis revealed a similar tissue-grouping phenomenon of ECs and heterogeneous metabolic gene signatures in ECs between tissues and between vascular beds within a single tissue in a tissue-type-dependent pattern. The EC atlas taxonomy enabled identification of EC subclusters in public scRNA-seq datasets and provides a powerful discovery tool and resource value.",cell_atlas,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8077/result,E-MTAB-8077,1
41,Single cell RNA-Seq of the mouse heart in response to chronic stress,"Background:Cardiac fibrosis is a key antecedent to many types of cardiac dysfunction including heart failure. Physiological factors leading to cardiac fibrosis have been recognized for decades. However, the specific cellular and molecular mediators that drive cardiac fibrosis, and the relative effect of disparate cell populations on cardiac fibrosis, remain unclear.Methods:We developed a novel cardiac single-cell transcriptomic strategy to characterize the cardiac cellulome, the network of cells that forms the heart. This method was used to profile the cardiac cellular ecosystem in response to 2 weeks of continuous administration of angiotensin II, a profibrotic stimulus that drives pathological cardiac remodeling.Results:Our analysis provides a comprehensive map of the cardiac cellular landscape uncovering multiple cell populations that contribute to pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix of the heart. Two phenotypically distinct fibroblast populations, Fibroblast-Cilpand Fibroblast-Thbs4, emerged after induction of tissue stress to promote fibrosis in the absence of smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts, a key profibrotic cell population. After angiotensin II treatment, Fibroblast-Cilpdevelops as the most abundant fibroblast subpopulation and the predominant fibrogenic cell type. Mapping intercellular communication networks within the heart, we identified key intercellular trophic relationships and shifts in cellular communication after angiotensin II treatment that promote the development of a profibrotic cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, the cellular responses to angiotensin II and the relative abundance of fibrogenic cells were sexually dimorphic.Conclusions:These results offer a valuable resource for exploring the cardiac cellular landscape in health and after chronic cardiovascular stress. These data provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote pathological remodeling of the mammalian heart, highlighting early transcriptional changes that precede chronic cardiac fibrosis.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8810/result,E-MTAB-8810,1

Here we genomically profile metastatic tumors and infiltrating lymphocytes. BAP1 alterations are overrepresented and found in 29/32 of cases. Reintroducing a functional BAP1 allele into a deficient patient-derived cell line, reveals a broad shift towards a transcriptomic subtype previously associated with better prognosis of the primary disease. One outlier tumor has a high mutational burden associated with UV-damage. CDKN2A deletions also occur, which are rarely present in primaries. A focused knockdown screen is used to investigate overexpressed genes associated withcopy number gains. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are in several cases found tumor-reactive, but expression of the immune checkpoint receptors TIM-3, TIGIT and LAG3 is also abundant. This study represents the largest whole-genome analysis of uveal melanoma to date, and presents an updated view of the metastatic disease.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-84/result,E-CURD-84,1

We used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize 35,000 CD4+regulatory (Treg) and memory (Tmem) T cells in mouse skin and colon, their respective draining lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen. In these tissues, we identified Treg cell subpopulations with distinct degrees of NLT phenotype. Subpopulation pseudotime ordering and gene kinetics were consistent in recruitment to skin and colon, yet the initial NLT-priming in LNs and the final stages of NLT functional adaptation reflected tissue-specific differences. Predicted kinetics were recapitulated using an in vivo melanoma-induction model, validating key regulators and receptors. Finally, we profiled human blood and NLT Treg and Tmem cells, and identified cross-mammalian conserved tissue signatures. In summary, we describe the relationship between Treg cell heterogeneity and recruitment to NLTs through the combined use of computational prediction and in vivo validation.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7311/result,E-MTAB-7311,1

Further characterization of the state of T cells in the CSF in healthy individuals is important for understanding how T cells provide protective immune surveillance without damaging the delicate environment of the CNS and providing tissue-specific context for understanding immune dysfunction in neuroinflammatory disease. Here, we have profiled T cells in the CSF of healthy human donors and have identified signatures related to cytotoxic capacity and tissue adaptation that are further exemplified in clonally expanded CSF T cells. By comparing profiles of clonally expanded T cells obtained from the CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy donors, we report that clonally expanded T cells from the CSF of patients with MS have heightened expression of genes related to T cell activation and cytotoxicity.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-30/result,E-HCAD-30,1
45,Single-nucleus RNA-seq resolves spatiotemporal developmental trajectories in the tomato shoot apex -scRNAseq,"Single cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing our understanding of development and response to environmental cues1â€“3. Recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled profiling gene expression pattern of heterogenous tissues and organs at single cellular level and have been widely applied in human and animal research4,5. Nevertheless, the existence of cell walls significantly encumbered its application in plant research. Protoplasts have been applied for scRNA-seq analysis, but mostly restricted to tissues amenable for wall digestion, such as root tips6â€“10. However, many cell types are resistant to protoplasting, and protoplasting may yield ectopic gene expression and bias proportions of cell types. Here we demonstrate a method with minimal artifacts for high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) that we use to profile tomato shoot apex cells. The obtained high-resolution expression atlas identifies numerous distinct cell types covering major shoot tissues and developmental stages, delineates developmental trajectories of mesophyll cells, vasculature cells, epidermal cells, and trichome cells. In addition, we identify key developmental regulators and reveal their hierarchy. Collectively, this study demonstrates the power of snRNA-seq to plant research and provides an unprecedented spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of heterogeneous shoot cells.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-54/result,E-ENAD-54,0

Here we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to assess changes in expression in multiple cell lineages in MS lesions and validated the results using multiplex in situ hybridization. We found selective vulnerability and loss of excitatory CUX2-expressing projection neurons in upper-cortical layers underlying meningeal inflammation; such MS neuron populations exhibited upregulation of stress pathway genes and long non-coding RNAs. Signatures of stressed oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes and activated microglia mapped most strongly to the rim of MS plaques. Notably, single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified phagocytosing microglia and/or macrophages by their ingestion and perinuclear import of myelin transcripts, confirmed by functional mouse and human culture assays.

Here, we present a 52,698-cell catalog of the TME transcriptome in human lung tumors at single-cell resolution, validated in independent samples where 40,250 additional cells were sequenced. By comparing with matching non-malignant lung samples, we reveal a highly complex TME that profoundly molds stromal cells. We identify 52 stromal cell subtypes, including novel subpopulations in cell types hitherto considered to be homogeneous, as well as transcription factors underlying their heterogeneity. For instance, we discover fibroblasts expressing different collagen sets, endothelial cells downregulating immune cell homing and genes coregulated with established immune checkpoint transcripts and correlating with T-cell activity. By assessing marker genes for these cell subtypes in bulk RNA-sequencing data from 1,572 patients, we illustrate how these correlate with survival, while immunohistochemistry for selected markers validates them as separate cellular entities in an independent series of lung tumors. Hence, in providing a comprehensive catalog of stromal cells types and by characterizing their phenotype and co-optive behavior, this resource provides deeper insights into lung cancer biology that will be helpful in advancing lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/result,E-MTAB-6653,1

The epithelium may contribute to these functions directly or by cross-talk with immune cells. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to resolve the spatiotemporal immune topology of the human kidney. We reveal anatomically defined expression patterns of immune genes within the epithelial compartment, with antimicrobial peptide transcripts evident in pelvic epithelium in the mature, but not fetal, kidney. A network of tissue-resident myeloid and lymphoid immune cells was evident in both fetal and mature kidney, with postnatal acquisition of transcriptional programs that promote infection-defense capabilities. Epithelial-immune cross-talk orchestrated localization of antibacterial macrophages and neutrophils to the regions of the kidney most susceptible to infection.

50,Single-cell RNA sequencing of adult Drosophila ovary identifies transcriptional programs governing oogenesis,"Oogenesis is a complex developmental process that involves spatiotemporally regulated coordination between the germline and supporting, somatic cell populations. This process has been modeled extensively using the Drosophila ovary. Although different ovarian cell types have been identified through traditional means, the large-scale expression profiles underlying each cell type remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we have built a transcriptomic data set for the adult Drosophila ovary and connected tissues. Using this data set, we identified the transcriptional trajectory of the entire follicle-cell population over the course of their development from stem cells to the oogenesis-to-ovulation transition. We further identify expression patterns during essential developmental events that take place in somatic and germline cell types such as differentiation, cell-cycle switching, migration, symmetry breaking, nurse-cell engulfment, egg-shell formation, and corpus luteum signaling. Extensive experimental validation of unique expression patterns in both ovarian and nearby, nonovarian cells also led to the identification of many new cell type-and stage-specific markers. The inclusion of several nearby tissue types in this data set also led to our identification of functional convergence in expression between distantly related cell types such as the immune-related genes that were similarly expressed in immune cells (hemocytes) and ovarian somatic cells (stretched cells) during their brief phagocytic role in nurse-cell engulfment. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the temporal regulation of genes in a cell-type specific manner during oogenesis and begin to reveal the relatedness in expression between cell and tissues types.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-146040/result,E-GEOD-146040,0

Here we present Palantir, an algorithm that models trajectories of differentiating cells by treating cell fate as a probabilistic process and leverages entropy to measure cell plasticity along the trajectory. Palantir generates a high-resolution pseudo-time ordering of cells and, for each cell state, assigns a probability of differentiating into each terminal state. We apply our algorithm to human bone marrow single-cell RNA sequencing data and detect important landmarks of hematopoietic differentiation. Palantir's resolution enables the identification of key transcription factors that drive lineage fate choice and closely track when cells lose plasticity. We show that Palantir outperforms existing algorithms in identifying cell lineages and recapitulating gene expression trends during differentiation, is generalizable to diverse tissue types, and is well-suited to resolving less-studied differentiating systems.",methodology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-6/result,E-HCAD-6,1
52,Defining the Activated Fibroblast Population in Lung Fibrosis Using Single Cell Sequencing,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disorder driven by unrelenting extracellular matrix deposition. Fibroblasts are recognized as the central mediators of extracellular matrix production in IPF; however, the characteristics of the underlying fibroblast cell populations in IPF remain poorly understood. Here, we use an unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model to characterize molecular responses to fibrotic injury. Lung cells were isolated on Day 11 to capture emerging fibrosis and gene expression was analyzed by three complementary techniques, which, together, generated a 49-gene signature that defined an activated subpopulation of fibroblasts. However, none of the identified genes were specific to the activated cells or to the disease setting, implying that the activated fibroblasts are not uniquely defined, but exhibit a similar, yet amplified, gene expression pattern to control cells. Our findings have important implications for fibrosis research, including:1) defining myofibroblasts with any single marker will fail to capture much of the underlying biology;2) fibroblast activation is poorly correlated with expression of transforming growth factor-Î² pathway genes;3) single-cell analysis provides insight into the mechanism of action of effective therapies (nintedanib);4) early events in lung fibrosis need not involve significant changes in fibroblast number; populations that do increase in number, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and proliferating myeloid cells, may merit closer examination for their role in pathogenesis.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-14/result,E-HCAD-14,1

To characterize this understudied process, we profiled and analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of âˆ¼10,000 testicular cells from four boys spanning puberty and compared them to those of infants and adults. During puberty, undifferentiated spermatogonia sequentially expand and differentiate prior to the initiation of gametogenesis. Notably, we identify a common pre-pubertal progenitor for Leydig and myoid cells and delineate candidate factors controlling pubertal differentiation. Furthermore, pre-pubertal Sertoli cells exhibit two distinct transcriptional states differing in metabolic profiles before converging to an alternative single mature population during puberty. Roles for testosterone in Sertoli cell maturation, antimicrobial peptide secretion, and spermatogonial differentiation are further highlighted through single-cell analysis of testosterone-suppressed transfemale testes.

Dissection of the developmental trajectories and the transcriptional networks that underlie them could aid understanding of the function of the root apical meristem in both dicots and monocots. Here, we present a single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing and chromatin accessibility survey of rice radicles. By temporal profiling of individual root tip cells we reconstruct continuous developmental trajectories of epidermal cells and ground tissues, and elucidate regulatory networks underlying cell fate determination in these cell lineages. We further identify characteristic processes, transcriptome profiles, and marker genes for these cell types and reveal conserved and divergent root developmental pathways between dicots and monocots. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the platform for functional genetic studies by using spatiotemporal modeling to identify a rice root meristematic mutant from a cell-specific gene cohort.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-52/result,E-ENAD-52,0

However, the processes that finely control these cell decisions remain largely unknown. The postnatal period covering the transition between early tissue expansion and the establishment of adult homeostasis provides a convenient model with which to explore this question. Here, we demonstrate that the onset of homeostasis in the epithelium of the mouse oesophagus is guided by the progressive build-up of mechanical strain at the organ level. Single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-organ stretching experiments revealed that the mechanical stress experienced by the growing oesophagus triggers the emergence of a bright KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) committed basal population, which balances cell proliferation and marks the transition towards homeostasis in a yes-associated protein (YAP)-dependent manner. Our results point to a simple mechanism whereby mechanical changes experienced at the whole-tissue level are integrated with those sensed at the cellular level to control epithelial cell fate.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8662/result,E-MTAB-8662,1
56,Stromal evolution of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma genetically engineered mouse models,"With only a fraction of patients responding to cancer immunotherapy, a better understanding of the entire tumor microenvironment is needed. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we chart the fibroblastic landscape during pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression in animal models. We identify a population of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) that are programmed by TGFÎ² and express the leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) protein. These LRRC15+CAFs surround tumor islets and are absent from normal pancreatic tissue. The presence of LRRC15+CAFs in human patients was confirmed in >80,000 single cells from 22 patients with PDAC as well as by using IHC on samples from 70 patients. Furthermore, immunotherapy clinical trials comprising more than 600 patients across six cancer types revealed elevated levels of the LRRC15+CAF signature correlated with poor response to anti-PD-L1 therapy. This work has important implications for targeting nonimmune elements of the tumor microenvironment to boost responses of patients with cancer to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: This study describes the single-cell landscape of CAFs in pancreatic cancer duringin vivotumor evolution. A TGFÎ²-driven, LRRC15+CAF lineage is associated with poor outcome in immunotherapy trial data comprising multiple solid-tumor entities and represents a target for combinatorial therapy.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 161.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8483/result,E-MTAB-8483,1

We used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cell census of the human thymus across the life span and to reconstruct T cell differentiation trajectories and T cell receptor (TCR) recombination kinetics. Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8Î±Î±+T cell populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states. In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment.

Despite an essential role for the CCS in heart development and function, the CCS has remained challenging to interrogate because of inherent obstacles including small cell numbers, large cell-type heterogeneity, complex anatomy, and difficulty in isolation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing allows for genome-wide analysis of gene expression at single-cell resolution.Objective:Assess the transcriptional landscape of the entire CCS at single-cell resolution by single-cell RNA-sequencing within the developing mouse heart.Methods and results:Wild-type, embryonic day 16.5 mouse hearts (n=6 per zone) were harvested and 3 zones of microdissection were isolated, including: Zone I-sinoatrial node region; Zone II-atrioventricular node/His region; and Zone III-bundle branch/Purkinje fiber region. Tissue was digested into single-cell suspensions, cells isolated, mRNA reverse transcribed, and barcoded before high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on over 22 000 cells, and all major cell types of the murine heart were successfully captured including bona fide clusters of cells consistent with each major component of the CCS. Unsupervised weighted gene coexpression network analysis led to the discovery of a host of novel CCS genes, a subset of which were validated using fluorescent in situ hybridization as well as whole-mount immunolabeling with volume imaging (iDISCO+) in 3 dimensions on intact mouse hearts. Further, subcluster analysis unveiled isolation of distinct CCS cell subtypes, including the clinically relevant but poorly characterized transitional cells that bridge the CCS and surrounding myocardium.Conclusions:Our study represents the first comprehensive assessment of the transcriptional profiles from the entire CCS at single-cell resolution and provides a characterization in the context of development and disease.",disease;developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-16/result,E-HCAD-16,1

Here, we perform the largest single-cell transcriptomic study of human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons to elucidate gene expression dynamics in response to cytotoxic and genetic stressors. We identify multiple neuronal subtypes with transcriptionally distinct profiles and differential sensitivity to stress, highlighting cellular heterogeneity in dopamine in vitro models. We validate this disease model by showing robust expression of PD GWAS genes and overlap with postmortem adult substantia nigra neurons. Importantly, stress signatures are ameliorated using felodipine, an FDA-approved drug. Using isogenic SNCA-A53T mutants, we find perturbations in glycolysis, cholesterol metabolism, synaptic signaling, and ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Overall, our study reveals cell type-specific perturbations in human dopamine neurons, which will further our understanding of PD and have implications for cell replacement therapies.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-9154/result,E-MTAB-9154,1

In addition, we identify Gal4 lines with specific expression patterns and perform lineage tracing of subpopulations of escort cells and follicle cells.

63,Single-cell transcriptomics of the human retinal pigment epithelium and choroid in health and macular degeneration,"The human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid are complex tissues that provide crucial support to the retina. Disease affecting either of these supportive tissues can lead to irreversible blindness in the setting of age-related macular degeneration. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on macular and peripheral regions of RPE-choroid from 7 human donor eyes in 2 independent experiments. In the first experiment, total RPE/choroid preparations were evaluated and expression profiles specific to RPE and major choroidal cell populations were identified. As choroidal endothelial cells represent a minority of the total RPE/choroidal cell population but are strongly implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis, a second single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment was performed using endothelial cells enriched by magnetic separation. In this second study, we identified gene expression signatures along the choroidal vascular tree, classifying the transcriptome of human choriocapillaris, arterial, and venous endothelial cells. We found that the choriocapillaris highly and specifically expresses the regulator of cell cycle gene (RGCC), a gene that responds to complement activation and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. In addition,RGCCwas the most up-regulated choriocapillaris gene in a donor diagnosed with AMD. These results provide a characterization of the human RPE and choriocapillaris transcriptome, offering potential insight into the mechanisms of choriocapillaris response to complement injury and choroidal vascular disease in age-related macular degeneration.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-135922/result,E-GEOD-135922,1
64,Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq analysis of pancreatic islets cells from both healthy and type II diabetic donors,"Identification of human disease signature genes typically requires samples from many donors to achieve statistical significance. Here, we show that single-cell heterogeneity analysis may overcome this hurdle by significantly improving the test sensitivity. We analyzed the transcriptome of 39,905 single islets cells from 9 donors and observed distinct Î² cell heterogeneity trajectories associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). We therefore developed RePACT, a sensitive single-cell analysis algorithm to identify both common and specific signature genes for obesity and T2D. We mapped both Î²-cell-specific genes and disease signature genes to the insulin regulatory network identified from a genome-wide CRISPR screen. Our integrative analysis discovered the previously unrecognized roles of the cohesin loading complex and the NuA4/Tip60 histone acetyltransferase complex in regulating insulin transcription and release. Our study demonstrated the power of combining single-cell heterogeneity analysis and functional genomics to dissect the etiology of complex diseases.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-31/result,E-HCAD-31,1
65,A human single cell atlas of the substantia nigra reveals novel cell specific pathways associated with the genetic risk of Parkinsonï¿½ï¿½s disease and neuropsychiatric disorders,"We describe a human single-nuclei transcriptomic atlas for the substantia nigra (SN), generated by sequencing approximately 17,000 nuclei from matched cortical and SN samples. We show that the common genetic risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with dopaminergic neuron (DaN)-specific gene expression, including mitochondrial functioning, protein folding and ubiquitination pathways. We identify a distinct cell type association between PD risk and oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression. Unlike Alzheimer's disease (AD), we find no association between PD risk and microglia or astrocytes, suggesting that neuroinflammation plays a less causal role in PD than AD. Beyond PD, we find associations between SN DaNs and GABAergic neuron gene expression and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Conditional analysis reveals that distinct neuropsychiatric disorders associate with distinct sets of neuron-specific genes but converge onto shared loci within oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors. This atlas guides our aetiological understanding by associating SN cell type expression profiles with specific disease risk.",disease;neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-25/result,E-HCAD-25,1
66,"Single Cell RNA-sequencing of murine tail interfollicular epidermis basal cells at postnatal days 7, 30 and in adult","During embryonic and postnatal development, organs and tissues grow steadily to achieve their final size at the end of puberty. However, little is known about the cellular dynamics that mediate postnatal growth. By combining in vivo clonal lineage tracing, proliferation kinetics, single-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro micro-pattern experiments, we resolved the cellular dynamics taking place during postnatal skin epidermis expansion. Our data revealed that harmonious growth is engineered by a single population of developmental progenitors presenting a fixed fate imbalance of self-renewing divisions with an ever-decreasing proliferation rate. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that epidermal developmental progenitors form a more uniform population compared with adult stem and progenitor cells. Finally, we found that the spatial pattern of cell division orientation is dictated locally by the underlying collagen fiber orientation. Our results uncover a simple design principle of organ growth where progenitors and differentiated cells expand in harmony with their surrounding tissues.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-146122/result,E-GEOD-146122,1
67,Single cell RNA-seq of adult human neural retina,"The retina is a specialized neural tissue that senses light and initiates image processing. Although the functional organization of specific retina cells has been well studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans. To comprehensively profile the human retina, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20,009 cells from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct cell populations representing all known neural retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, MÃ¼ller glia, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and putative early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed the loss of MALAT1 expression with longer post-mortem time, which potentially suggested a novel role of MALAT1 in rod photoreceptor degeneration. We have demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult MÃ¼ller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to understanding retinal biology and disease.",neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7316/result,E-MTAB-7316,1

Recent landmark studies revealed pervasive differences in renal embryogenesis between mouse and human. The scarcity of detailed gene expression data in humans therefore hampers a thorough understanding of human kidney development and the possible developmental origin of kidney diseases. In this paper, we present a single-cell transcriptomics study of the human fetal kidney. We identified 22 cell types and a host of marker genes. Comparison of samples from different developmental ages revealed continuous gene expression changes in podocytes. To demonstrate the usefulness of our data set, we explored the heterogeneity of the nephrogenic niche, localized podocyte precursors, and confirmed disease-associated marker genes. With close to 18,000 renal cells from five different developmental ages, this study provides a rich resource for the elucidation of human kidney development, easily accessible through an interactive web application.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-114530/result,E-GEOD-114530,1

Because our understanding of CIN mechanisms is based largely on analysing established cell lines, we developed a workflow for generating ex vivo cultures from patient biopsies to provide models that support interrogation of CIN mechanisms in cells not extensively cultured in vitro. Here, we describe a ""living biobank"" of ovarian cancer models with extensive replicative capacity, derived from both ascites and solid biopsies. Fifteen models are characterised by p53 profiling, exome sequencing and transcriptomics, and karyotyped using single-cell whole-genome sequencing. Time-lapse microscopy reveals catastrophic and highly heterogeneous mitoses, suggesting that analysis of established cell lines probably underestimates mitotic dysfunction in advanced human cancers. Drug profiling reveals cisplatin sensitivities consistent with patient responses, demonstrating that this workflow has potential to generate personalized avatars with advantages over current pre-clinical models and the potential to guide clinical decision making.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8559/result,E-MTAB-8559,1

Here we establish fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-specific fate-mapping in mice to define their embryonic origin and differentiation trajectories. Our data show that all reticular cell subsets descend from multipotent progenitors emerging at embryonic day 19.5 from periarterial progenitors. Commitment of FRC progenitors is concluded during the first week of postnatal life through occupation of niches along developing central arterioles. Single cell transcriptomic analysis facilitated deconvolution of FRC differentiation trajectories and indicated that perivascular reticular cells function both as adult lymphoid organizer cells and mural cell progenitors. The lymphotoxin-Î² receptor-independent sustenance of postnatal progenitor stemness unveils that systemic immune surveillance in the splenic white pulp is governed through subset specification of reticular cells from a multipotent periarterial progenitor cell. In sum, the finding that discrete signaling events in perivascular niches determine the differentiation trajectories of reticular cell networks explains the development of distinct microenvironmental niches in secondary and tertiary lymphoid tissues that are crucial for the induction and regulation of innate and adaptive immune processes.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7703/result,E-MTAB-7703,1

Macrophages accumulate in fibrosis, but the role of specific subgroups in supporting fibrogenesis has not been investigated in vivo. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the heterogeneity of macrophages in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. A novel computational framework for the annotation of scRNA-seq by reference to bulk transcriptomes (SingleR) enabled the subclustering of macrophages and revealed a disease-associated subgroup with a transitional gene expression profile intermediate between monocyte-derived and alveolar macrophages. These CX3CR1+SiglecF+transitional macrophages localized to the fibrotic niche and had a profibrotic effect in vivo. Human orthologs of genes expressed by the transitional macrophages were upregulated in samples from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Although major cell types have been identified in the mouse intestinal epithelium, cell type-specific markers and functional assignments are largely unavailable for human intestine. Here, our single-cell RNA-seq analyses of 14,537 epithelial cells from human ileum, colon, and rectum reveal different nutrient absorption preferences in the small and large intestine, suggest the existence of Paneth-like cells in the large intestine, and identify potential new marker genes for human transient-amplifying cells and goblet cells. We have validated some of these insights by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and functional analyses. Furthermore, we show both common and differential features of the cellular landscapes between the human and mouse ilea. Therefore, our data provide the basis for detailed characterization of human intestine cell constitution and functions, which would be helpful for a better understanding of human intestine disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal tumorigenesis.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-125970/result,E-GEOD-125970,1

Here we report studies of a patient with chronic GvHD (cGvHD) carrying persistent CD4+T cell clonal expansion harboring somatic mTOR, NFKB2, and TLR2 mutations. In the screening cohort (n = 134), we detect the mTOR P2229R kinase domain mutation in two additional cGvHD patients, but not in healthy or HSCT patients without cGvHD. Functional analyses of the mTOR mutation indicate a gain-of-function alteration and activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways, leading to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and real-time impedance measurements support increased cytotoxicity of mutated CD4+T cells. High throughput drug-sensitivity testing suggests that mutations induce resistance to mTOR inhibitors, but increase sensitivity for HSP90 inhibitors. Our findings imply that somatic mutations may contribute to aberrant T cell proliferations and persistent immune activation in cGvHD, thereby paving the way for targeted therapies.",disease;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8911/result,E-MTAB-8911,1

By generating and exploiting a high-resolution single-cell gene expression atlas ofArabidopsisroots, we show an enrichment of TARGET OF MONOPTEROS 5/LONESOME HIGHWAY (TMO5/LHW) target gene responses in root hair cells. The TMO5/LHW heterodimer triggers biosynthesis of mobile cytokinin in vascular cells and increases root hair density during low-phosphate conditions by modifying both the length and cell fate of epidermal cells. Moreover, root hair responses in phosphate-deprived conditions are TMO5- and cytokinin-dependent.

Here we report the transcriptional profiles of 116,312 single cells from mouse embryos collected at nine sequential time points ranging from 6.5 to 8.5 days post-fertilization. We construct a molecular map of cellular differentiation from pluripotency towards all major embryonic lineages, and explore the complex events involved in the convergence of visceral and primitive streak-derived endoderm. Furthermore, we use single-cell profiling to show that Tal1-/-chimeric embryos display defects in early mesoderm diversification, and we thus demonstrate how combining temporal and transcriptional information can illuminate gene function.

With a spectrum of podocyte-expressed gene mutations causing chronic disease, an enhanced understanding of podocyte development and function to create relevant in vitro podocyte models is a clinical imperative. To characterize podocyte development, scRNA-seq was performed on human fetal kidneys, identifying distinct transcriptional signatures accompanying the differentiation of functional podocytes from progenitors. Interestingly, organoid-generated podocytes exhibited highly similar, progressive transcriptional profiles despite an absence of the vasculature, although abnormal gene expression was pinpointed in late podocytes. On transplantation into mice, organoid-derived podocytes recruited the host vasculature and partially corrected transcriptional profiles. Thus, human podocyte development is mostly intrinsically regulated and vascular interactions refine maturation. These studies support the application of organoid-derived podocytes to model disease and to restore or replace normal kidney functions.",disease;developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-124472/result,E-GEOD-124472,1

The heterogeneity of Drosophila immune cells (hemocytes) remains an open question. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we find that the hemocytes display distinct features in the embryo, a closed and rapidly developing system, compared to the larva, which is exposed to environmental and metabolic challenges. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify fourteen hemocyte clusters present in unchallenged larvae and associated with distinct processes, e.g., proliferation, phagocytosis, metabolic homeostasis, and humoral response. Finally, we characterize the changes occurring in the hemocyte clusters upon wasp infestation, which triggers the differentiation of a novel hemocyte type, the lamellocyte.

We also inferred gene co-expression modules that coincide with distinct tissue types across developmental time, and used them to track patterning-relevant cell populations of the forming digits. Droplet-based single cell RNA-seq of dissociated developing limbs of chicken at three different stages","Background:Through precise implementation of distinct cell type specification programs, differentially regulated in both space and time, complex patterns emerge during organogenesis. Thanks to its easy experimental accessibility, the developing chicken limb has long served as a paradigm to study vertebrate pattern formation. Through decades' worth of research, we now have a firm grasp on the molecular mechanisms driving limb formation at the tissue-level. However, to elucidate the dynamic interplay between transcriptional cell type specification programs and pattern formation at its relevant cellular scale, we lack appropriately resolved molecular data at the genome-wide level. Here, making use of droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing, we catalogue the developmental emergence of distinct tissue types and their transcriptome dynamics in the distal chicken limb, the so-called autopod, at cellular resolution.Results:Using single-cell RNA-sequencing technology, we sequenced a total of 17,628 cells coming from three key developmental stages of chicken autopod patterning. Overall, we identified 23 cell populations with distinct transcriptional profiles. Amongst them were small, albeit essential populations like the apical ectodermal ridge, demonstrating the ability to detect even rare cell types. Moreover, we uncovered the existence of molecularly distinct sub-populations within previously defined compartments of the developing limb, some of which have important signaling functions during autopod pattern formation. Finally, we inferred gene co-expression modules that coincide with distinct tissue types across developmental time, and used them to track patterning-relevant cell populations of the forming digits.Conclusions:We provide a comprehensive functional genomics resource to study the molecular effectors of chicken limb patterning at cellular resolution. Our single-cell transcriptomic atlas captures all major cell populations of the developing autopod, and highlights the transcriptional complexity in many of its components. Finally, integrating our data-set with other single-cell transcriptomics resources will enable researchers to assess molecular similarities in orthologous cell types across the major tetrapod clades, and provide an extensive candidate gene list to functionally test cell-type-specific drivers of limb morphological diversification.",disease;developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-12/result,E-CURD-12,0

Here, we used the high-throughput Drop-seq approach to profile >12,000 cells from Arabidopsis roots. This identified numerous distinct cell types, covering all major root tissues and developmental stages, and illuminated specific marker genes for these populations. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this approach to study the impact of environmental conditions on developmental processes. Analysis of roots grown with or without sucrose supplementation uncovers changes in the relative frequencies of cell types in response to sucrose. Finally, we characterize the transcriptome changes that occur across endodermis development and identify nearly 800 genes with dynamic expression as this tissue differentiates.

Further detailed analysis revealed proliferating subpopulations, enrichment of cell type-specific transcription factors, and putative intercellular communication in the fetomaternal microenvironment.

83,Interferon gene therapy reprograms the leukemia microenvironment inducing protective immunity to multiple tumor antigens,"Immunotherapy is emerging as a new pillar of cancer treatment with potential to cure. However, many patients still fail to respond to these therapies. Among the underlying factors, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a major role. Here we show that monocyte-mediated gene delivery of IFNÎ± inhibits leukemia in a mouse model. IFN gene therapy counteracts leukemia-induced expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and imposes an immunostimulatory program to the TME, as shown by bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses. This reprogramming promotes T-cell priming and effector function against multiple surrogate tumor-specific antigens, inhibiting leukemia growth in our experimental model. Durable responses are observed in a fraction of mice and are further increased combining gene therapy with checkpoint blockers. Furthermore, IFN gene therapy strongly enhances anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells engineered with tumor-specific TCR or CAR, overcoming suppressive signals in the leukemia TME. These findings warrant further investigations on the potential development of our gene therapy strategy towards clinical testing.",cancer;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6487/result,E-MTAB-6487,1

However, the existence and function of ILCs in other vertebrates are poorly understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a comprehensive atlas of zebrafish lymphocytes during tissue homeostasis and after immune challenge. We profiled 14,080 individual cells from the gut of wild-type zebrafish, as well as ofrag1-deficient zebrafish that lack T and B cells, and discovered populations of ILC-like cells. We uncovered arorc-positive subset of ILCs that could express cytokines associated with type 1, 2, and 3 responses upon immune challenge. Specifically, these ILC-like cells expressedil22andtnfaafter exposure to inactivated bacteria oril13after exposure to helminth extract. Cytokine-producing ILC-like cells express a specific repertoire of novel immune-type receptors, likely involved in recognition of environmental cues.

Relatively little is known about the molecular events that integrate this critical progression along the male genital ducts in man. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing to construct an atlas of the human proximal epididymis. We find that the CFTR, which is pivotal in normal epididymis fluid transport, is most abundant in surface epithelial cells in the efferent ducts and in rare clear cells in the caput epididymis, suggesting region-specific functional properties. We reveal transcriptional signatures for multiple cell clusters, which identify the individual roles of principal, apical, narrow, basal, clear, halo, and stromal cells in the epididymis. A marked cell type-specific distribution of function is seen along the duct with local specialization of individual cell types integrating processes of sperm maturation.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-38/result,E-HCAD-38,1
86,Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of rice root tips ï¿½C Oryza sativa Japonica Group,"There are two main types of root systems in flowering plants, namely taproot systems of dicots and fibrous root systems found in monocots. Despite this fundamental split, our current knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanism driving root development is mainly based on studies of the dicot model Arabidopsis. However, the world major crops are monocots and little is known about the transcriptional programs underlying cell-type specification in this clade. Here, we report the transcriptomes of more than 20 000 single cells derived from root tips of two agronomically important rice cultivars. Using combined computational and experimental analyses we were able to robustly identify most of the major cell types and define novel cell-type-specific marker genes for both cultivars. Importantly, we found divergent cell types associated with specific regulatory programs, including phytohormone biosynthesis, signaling, and response, which were well conserved between the two rice cultivars. In addition, we detected substantial differences between the cell-type transcript profiles of Arabidopsis and rice. These species-specific features emphasize the importance of analyzing tissues across diverse model species, including rice.

In this study, we characterized single-cell transcriptional profiles of the murine non-myocyte cardiac cellular landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Detailed molecular analyses revealed the diversity of the cardiac cellulome and facilitated the development of techniques to isolate understudied cardiac cell populations, such as mural cells and glia. Our analyses also revealed extensive networks of intercellular communication and suggested prevalent sexual dimorphism in gene expression in the heart.

There are currently no effective antifibrotic therapies available. To obtain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and enable the discovery of therapeutic targets, here we profile the transcriptomes of more than 100,000 single human cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types that are found in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. We identify a scar-associated TREM2+CD9+subpopulation of macrophages, which expands in liver fibrosis, differentiates from circulating monocytes and is pro-fibrogenic. We also define ACKR1+and PLVAP+endothelial cells that expand in cirrhosis, are topographically restricted to the fibrotic niche and enhance the transmigration of leucocytes. Multi-lineage modelling of ligand and receptor interactions between the scar-associated macrophages, endothelial cells and PDGFRÎ±+collagen-producing mesenchymal cells reveals intra-scar activity of several pro-fibrogenic pathways including TNFRSF12A, PDGFR and NOTCH signalling. Our work dissects unanticipated aspects of the cellular and molecular basis of human organ fibrosis at a single-cell level, and provides a conceptual framework for the discovery of rational therapeutic targets in liver cirrhosis.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-21/result,E-HCAD-21,1
90,A single cell view of the transcriptome during lateral root initiation of Arabidopsis thaliana,"Root architecture is a major determinant of plant fitness and is under constant modification in response to favorable and unfavorable environmental stimuli. Beyond impacts on the primary root, the environment can alter the position, spacing, density, and length of secondary or lateral roots. Lateral root development is among the best-studied examples of plant organogenesis, yet there are still many unanswered questions about its earliest steps. Among the challenges faced in capturing these first molecular events is the fact that this process occurs in a small number of cells with unpredictable timing. Single-cell sequencing methods afford the opportunity to isolate the specific transcriptional changes occurring in cells undergoing this fate transition. Using this approach, we successfully captured the transcriptomes of initiating lateral root primordia in Arabidopsis thaliana and discovered many upregulated genes associated with this process. We developed a method to selectively repress target gene transcription in the xylem pole pericycle cells where lateral roots originate and demonstrated that the expression of several of these targets is required for normal root development. We also discovered subpopulations of cells in the pericycle and endodermal cell files that respond to lateral root initiation, highlighting the coordination across cell files required for this fate transition.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-158761/result,E-GEOD-158761,0
91,Single cell sequencing reveals phloem loading occurs via the abaxial bundle sheath cells in maize leaves,"Leaves are asymmetric, with different functions for adaxial and abaxial tissue. The bundle sheath (BS) of C3 barley (Hordeum vulgare) is dorsoventrally differentiated into three types of cells: adaxial structural, lateral S-type, and abaxial L-type BS cells. Based on plasmodesmatal connections between S-type cells and mestome sheath (parenchymatous cell layer below bundle sheath), S-type cells likely transfer assimilates toward the phloem. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate BS differentiation in C4 maize (Zea mays L.) plants. Abaxial BS (abBS) cells of rank-2 intermediate veins specifically expressed three SWEET sucrose uniporters (SWEET13a, b, and c) and UmamiT amino acid efflux transporters. SWEET13a, b, c mRNAs were also detected in the phloem parenchyma (PP). We show that maize has acquired a mechanism for phloem loading in which abBS cells provide the main route for apoplasmic sucrose transfer toward the phloem. This putative route predominates in veins responsible for phloem loading (rank-2 intermediate), whereas rank-1 intermediate and major veins export sucrose from the PP adjacent to the sieve element companion cell complex, as in Arabidopsis thaliana. We surmise that abBS identity is subject to dorsoventral patterning and has components of PP identity. These observations provide insights into the unique transport-specific properties of abBS cells and support a modification to the canonical phloem loading pathway in maize.",developmental_biology;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-157757/result,E-GEOD-157757,0

Analysis of transcriptome of single cells revealed similar expression of core pluripotency genes, as well as genes associated with naive and primed states of pluripotency. Analysis of individual cells from four samples consisting of two different iPSC lines each grown in the two culture media revealed a shared subpopulation structure with three main subpopulations different in pluripotency states. By implementing a machine learning approach, we estimated that most cells within each subpopulation are very similar between all four samples. The single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of iPSC lines grown in both media reports the molecular signature in StemFlex medium and how it compares to that observed in the TeSR-E8 medium.",developmental_biology;methodology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6524/result,E-MTAB-6524,1
93,Monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6 are differentially required for cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity by CAR-T cells.,"In the clinic, chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR T) cell therapy is frequently associated with life-threatening cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Understanding the nature of these pathologies and developing treatments for them are hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models. Herein, we describe a mouse model recapitulating key features of CRS and neurotoxicity. In humanized mice with high leukemia burden, CAR T cell-mediated clearance of cancer triggered high fever and elevated IL-6 levels, which are hallmarks of CRS. Human monocytes were the major source of IL-1 and IL-6 during CRS. Accordingly, the syndrome was prevented by monocyte depletion or by blocking IL-6 receptor with tocilizumab. Nonetheless, tocilizumab failed to protect mice from delayed lethal neurotoxicity, characterized by meningeal inflammation. Instead, the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra abolished both CRS and neurotoxicity, resulting in substantially extended leukemia-free survival. These findings offer a therapeutic strategy to tackle neurotoxicity and open new avenues to safer CAR T cell therapies.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6505/result,E-MTAB-6505,1
94,Single-cell analysis of T-cells from mouse neonate thymuses in a wild type control and a placental specific isoform of Igf2 knock-down (igf2-P0),"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) causes a wide variety of defects in the neonate which can lead to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, anxiety and other disorders later in life. However, the effect of FGR on the immune system, is poorly understood. We used a well-characterized mouse model of FGR in which placental Igf-2 production is lost due to deletion of the placental specificIgf-2P0promotor. The thymi in such animals were reduced in mass with a ~70% reduction in cellularity. We used single cell RNA sequencing (Drop-Seq) to analyze 7,264 thymus cells collected at postnatal day 6. We identified considerable heterogeneity among the Cd8/Cd4 double positive cells with one subcluster showing marked upregulation of transcripts encoding a sub-set of proteins that contribute to the surface of the ribosome. The cells from the FGR animals were underrepresented in this cluster. Furthermore, the distribution of cells from the FGR animals was skewed with a higher proportion of immature double negative cells and fewer mature T-cells. Cell cycle regulator transcripts also varied across clusters. The T-cell deficit in FGR mice persisted into adulthood, even when body and organ weights approached normal levels due to catch-up growth. This finding complements the altered immunity found in growth restricted human infants. This reduction in T-cellularity may have implications for adult immunity, adding to the list of adult conditions in which thein uteroenvironment is a contributory factor.",developmental_biology;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/result,E-MTAB-6945,1
95,Single-nucleus RNA-seq resolves spatiotemporal developmental trajectories in the tomato shoot apex - snRNAseq,"Single cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing our understanding of development and response to environmental cues1â€“3. Recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled profiling gene expression pattern of heterogenous tissues and organs at single cellular level and have been widely applied in human and animal research4,5. Nevertheless, the existence of cell walls significantly encumbered its application in plant research. Protoplasts have been applied for scRNA-seq analysis, but mostly restricted to tissues amenable for wall digestion, such as root tips6â€“10. However, many cell types are resistant to protoplasting, and protoplasting may yield ectopic gene expression and bias proportions of cell types. Here we demonstrate a method with minimal artifacts for high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) that we use to profile tomato shoot apex cells. The obtained high-resolution expression atlas identifies numerous distinct cell types covering major shoot tissues and developmental stages, delineates developmental trajectories of mesophyll cells, vasculature cells, epidermal cells, and trichome cells. In addition, we identify key developmental regulators and reveal their hierarchy. Collectively, this study demonstrates the power of snRNA-seq to plant research and provides an unprecedented spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of heterogeneous shoot cells.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-53/result,E-ENAD-53,0

Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae. We resolved plasmatocytes into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the identification of intermediate states. Further, we discovered rare subsets within crystal cells and lamellocytes that express fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligandbranchlessand receptorbreathless, respectively. We demonstrate that these FGF components are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocytes and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-56/result,E-CURD-56,0

98,Molecular Mechanisms Driving Switch Behavior in Xylem Cell Differentiation,"Plant xylem cells conduct water and mineral nutrients. Although most plant cells are totipotent, xylem cells are unusual and undergo terminal differentiation. Many genes regulating this process are well characterized, including the Vascular-related NAC Domain 7 (VND7), MYB46, and MYB83 transcription factors, which are proposed to act in interconnected feedforward loops (FFLs). Less is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the terminal transition to xylem cell differentiation. Here, we generate whole-root and single-cell data, which demonstrate that VND7 initiates sharp switching of root cells to xylem cell identity. Based on these data, we identified 4 candidate VND7 downstream target genes capable of generating this switch. Although MYB46 responds to VND7 induction, it is not among these targets. This system provides an important model to study the emergent properties that may give rise to totipotency relative to terminal differentiation and reveals xylem cell subtypes.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-30/result,E-ENAD-30,0

MAIT cells acquire effector functions during thymic development, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the developmental path of 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes. In addition to the known MAIT1 and MAIT17 effector subsets selected on bone-marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, we identified 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes that were selected on thymic epithelial cells and differentiated into CD44-naive T cells. MAIT cell positive selection required signaling through the adapter, SAP, that controlled the expression of the transcription factor, ZBTB16. Pseudotemporal ordering of single cells revealed transcriptional trajectories of 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes selected on either thymic epithelial cells or hematopoietic cells.

Despite recent advances, our understanding of its pathophysiology remains incomplete. The aim of this study was to provide deeper insight into the complex network of molecular and cellular changes that underlie diabetic retinopathy by systematically mapping the transcriptional changes that occur in the different cellular compartments of the degenerating diabetic mouse retina.Methods:Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on retinal tissue from 12-week-old wild-type and Akimba (Ins2AkitaÃ—Vegfa+/-) mice, which are known to replicate features of clinical diabetic retinopathy. This resulted in transcriptome data for 9474 retinal cells, which could be annotated to eight distinct retinal cell types. Using STRING analysis, we studied differentially expressed gene networks in neuronal, glial and immune cell compartments to create a comprehensive view on the pathological changes that occur in the Akimba retina. Using subclustering analysis, we further characterised macroglial and inflammatory cell subpopulations. Prominent findings were confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry, western blotting and ELISA.Results:At 12 weeks, the Akimba retina was found to display degeneration of rod photoreceptors and presence of inflammatory cells, identified by subclustering analysis as monocyte, macrophage and microglial populations. Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the rod, cone, bipolar cell and macroglial compartments indicated changes in cell metabolism and ribosomal gene expression, gliosis, activation of immune system pathways and redox and metal ion dyshomeostasis. Experiments at the protein level supported a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), activation of microglia/macrophages (isolectin-B4), metal ion and oxidative stress response (metallothionein and haem oxygenase-1) and reactive macroglia (glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100) in the Akimba retina, compared with wild-type mice. Our single-cell approach also indicates macroglial subpopulations with distinct fibrotic, inflammatory and gliotic profiles.Conclusions/interpretation:Our study identifies molecular pathways underlying inflammatory, metabolic and oxidative stress-mediated changes in the Akimba mouse model of diabetic retinopathy and distinguishes distinct functional subtypes of inflammatory and macroglial cells.Data availability:RNA-seq data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI ( www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress ) under accession number E-MTAB-9061.

101,Dynamics of gene expression in single root cells of Arabidopsis thaliana,"Single cell RNA sequencing can yield high-resolution cell-type-specific expression signatures that reveal new cell types and the developmental trajectories of cell lineages. Here, we apply this approach to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root cells to capture gene expression in 3,121 root cells. We analyze these data with Monocle 3, which orders single cell transcriptomes in an unsupervised manner and uses machine learning to reconstruct single cell developmental trajectories along pseudotime. We identify hundreds of genes with cell-type-specific expression, with pseudotime analysis of several cell lineages revealing both known and novel genes that are expressed along a developmental trajectory. We identify transcription factor motifs that are enriched in early and late cells, together with the corresponding candidate transcription factors that likely drive the observed expression patterns. We assess and interpret changes in total RNA expression along developmental trajectories and show that trajectory branch points mark developmental decisions. Finally, by applying heat stress to whole seedlings, we address the longstanding question of possible heterogeneity among cell types in the response to an abiotic stress. Although the response of canonical heat-shock genes dominates expression across cell types, subtle but significant differences in other genes can be detected among cell types. Taken together, our results demonstrate that single cell transcriptomics holds promise for studying plant development and plant physiology with unprecedented resolution.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-121619/result,E-GEOD-121619,0

However, studies on characterizing heterogeneity of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in liquid biopsies are rare because of the rarity and low viability of DTCs as well as a large number of non-tumor cells. Here, high-throughput single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology and rare DTC enrichment method are employed to decipher the heterogeneity and distinct molecular signatures of DTCs in malignant pleural effusion (MPE) from lung adenocarcinoma. Single-cell transcriptomes of 8213 MPE-derived cells are acquired for bioinformatics analysis. In these cells from MPE, five main cell populations including tumor, mesothelial, monocyte, T and B cells are identified with specific markers for each group. Tumor cells present in MPE are further divided into four distinct subgroups that are found to be associated with immune response, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion, respectively. Based on the single-cell dataset of MPE-derived DTCs, 19 tumor-specific markers are identified that are also highly expressed at RNA and protein levels in tumor tissues as candidate markers for detection of extraordinarily rare circulating tumor cells in the blood.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8530/result,E-MTAB-8530,1

Droplet-based single cell RNA-seq of dissociated developing limbs of chicken at three different stages","Background:Through precise implementation of distinct cell type specification programs, differentially regulated in both space and time, complex patterns emerge during organogenesis. Thanks to its easy experimental accessibility, the developing chicken limb has long served as a paradigm to study vertebrate pattern formation. Through decades' worth of research, we now have a firm grasp on the molecular mechanisms driving limb formation at the tissue-level. However, to elucidate the dynamic interplay between transcriptional cell type specification programs and pattern formation at its relevant cellular scale, we lack appropriately resolved molecular data at the genome-wide level. Here, making use of droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing, we catalogue the developmental emergence of distinct tissue types and their transcriptome dynamics in the distal chicken limb, the so-called autopod, at cellular resolution.Results:Using single-cell RNA-sequencing technology, we sequenced a total of 17,628 cells coming from three key developmental stages of chicken autopod patterning. Overall, we identified 23 cell populations with distinct transcriptional profiles. Amongst them were small, albeit essential populations like the apical ectodermal ridge, demonstrating the ability to detect even rare cell types. Moreover, we uncovered the existence of molecularly distinct sub-populations within previously defined compartments of the developing limb, some of which have important signaling functions during autopod pattern formation. Finally, we inferred gene co-expression modules that coincide with distinct tissue types across developmental time, and used them to track patterning-relevant cell populations of the forming digits.Conclusions:We provide a comprehensive functional genomics resource to study the molecular effectors of chicken limb patterning at cellular resolution. Our single-cell transcriptomic atlas captures all major cell populations of the developing autopod, and highlights the transcriptional complexity in many of its components. Finally, integrating our data-set with other single-cell transcriptomics resources will enable researchers to assess molecular similarities in orthologous cell types across the major tetrapod clades, and provide an extensive candidate gene list to functionally test cell-type-specific drivers of limb morphological diversification.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-13/result,E-CURD-13,0

The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of ligand-receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type specificity of cell-cell communication via these molecular interactions.

106,snRNA-seq of whole hearts from adult fzt:DU mice,"The recent development and broad application of sequencing techniques at the single-cell level is generating an unprecedented amount of data. The different techniques have their individual limits, but the datasets also offer unexpected possibilities when utilized collectively. Here, we applied snRNA-seq in whole adult murine hearts from an inbred (C57BL/6NRj) and an outbred (Fzt:DU) mouse strain to directly compare the data with the publicly available scRNA-seq data of the tabula muris project. Explicitly choosing a single-nucleus approach allowed us to pin down the typical heart tissue-specific technical bias, coming up with novel insights on the mammalian heart cell composition. For our integrated dataset, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells constituted the three main cell populations accounting for about 75% of all cells. However, their numbers severely differed between the individual datasets, with cardiomyocyte proportions ranging from about 9% in the tabula muris data to around 23% for our BL6 data, representing the prime example for cell capture technique related bias when using a conventional single-cell approach for these large cells. Most strikingly in our comparison was the discovery of a minor population of cardiomyocytes characterized by proliferation markers that could not be identified by analyzing the datasets individually. It is now widely accepted that the heart has an, albeit very restricted, regenerative potential. However there is still an ongoing debate where new cardiomyocytes arise from. Our findings support the idea that the renewal of the cardiomyocyte pool is driven by cytokinesis of resident cardiomyocytes rather than differentiation of progenitor cells. We thus provide data that can contribute to an understanding of heart cell regeneration, which is a prerequisite for future applications to enhance the process of heart repair.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8751/result,E-MTAB-8751,1
107,Single-cell Transcriptomic Atlas of the Human Retina Identifies Cell Types Associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration [Microfluidics],"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. However, it has been challenging to identify the cell types associated with AMD given the genetic complexity of the disease. Here we perform massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human retinas using two independent platforms, and report the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina. Using a multi-resolution network-based analysis, we identify all major retinal cell types, and their corresponding gene expression signatures. Heterogeneity is observed within macroglia, suggesting that human retinal glia are more diverse than previously thought. Finally, GWAS-based enrichment analysis identifies glia, vascular cells, and cone photoreceptors to be associated with the risk of AMD. These data provide a detailed analysis of the human retina, and show how scRNA-seq can provide insight into cell types involved in complex, inflammatory genetic diseases.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-137537/result,E-GEOD-137537,1
108,"scRNA-seq analysis of lung CD64-expressing mononuclear cells, patrolling and classical monocytes from steady-state C57BL/6J mice","Resident tissue macrophages (RTM) can fulfill various tasks during development, homeostasis, inflammation and repair. In the lung, non-alveolar RTM, called interstitial macrophages (IM), importantly contribute to tissue homeostasis but remain little characterized. Here we show, using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), two phenotypically distinct subpopulations of long-lived monocyte-derived IM, i.e. CD206+and CD206-IM, as well as a discrete population of extravasating CD64+CD16.2+monocytes. CD206+IM are peribronchial self-maintaining RTM that constitutively produce high levels of chemokines and immunosuppressive cytokines. Conversely, CD206-IM preferentially populate the alveolar interstitium and exhibit features of antigen-presenting cells. In addition, our data support that CD64+CD16.2+monocytes arise from intravascular Ly-6Clopatrolling monocytes that enter the tissue at steady-state to become putative precursors of CD206-IM. This study expands our knowledge about the complexity of lung IM and reveals an ontogenic pathway for one IM subset, an important step for elaborating future macrophage-targeted therapies.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7678/result,E-MTAB-7678,1

We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to determine stromal adaptations in murine melanoma at different points of tumour development. Naive lymphocytes recruited from lymph nodes underwent activation and clonal expansion within the tumour, prior to PD1 and Lag3 expression, while tumour-associated myeloid cells promoted the formation of a suppressive niche through cytokine secretion and inhibitory T cell interactions. We identified three temporally distinct cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) populations displaying unique signatures, and verified these in human datasets. In early tumours, immune CXCL12/CSF1 and complement-expressing CAFs supported recruitment of macrophages, whereas contractile CAFs became more prevalent in later tumours. This study highlights the complex interplay and increasing diversity among cells that co-evolve with the tumour, indicating that from early stages of development, stromal cells acquire the capacity to modulate the immune landscape towards suppression.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7427/result,E-MTAB-7427,1

Single cell analysis of mouse heart valve cells was used to evaluate cell heterogeneity during postnatal ECM remodeling and leaflet morphogenesis. The transcriptomic analysis of single cells from postnatal day (P)7 and P30 murine aortic (AoV) and mitral (MV) heart valves uncovered distinct subsets of melanocytes, immune and endothelial cells present at P7 and P30. By contrast, interstitial cell populations are different from P7 to P30. P7 valve leaflets exhibit two distinct collagen- and glycosaminoglycan-expressing interstitial cell clusters, and prevalent ECM gene expression. At P30, four interstitial cell clusters are apparent with leaflet specificity and differential expression of complement factors, ECM proteins and osteogenic genes. This initial transcriptomic analysis of postnatal heart valves at single cell resolution demonstrates that subpopulations of endothelial and immune cells are relatively constant throughout postnatal development, but interstitial cell subpopulations undergo changes in gene expression and cellular functions in primordial and mature valves.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-18/result,E-HCAD-18,1

Induced DCs acquire a step-wise DC1 transcriptional signature at the single cell level as assessed with droplet based scRNA-seq. Hence, we provide evidence that antigen presentation can be dynamically programmed by a small combination of TFs in human cells. Moreover, it represents a platform for generating autologous DC1, the most attractive DC subset for cancer immunotherapy.",cancer;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-13/result,E-HCAD-13,1

It is unknown whether the innate myeloid response differs with disease severity and whether markers of innate immunity discriminate high-risk patients. Thus, we performed high-dimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient peripheral blood cells and detected disappearance of non-classical CD14LowCD16Highmonocytes, accumulation of HLA-DRLowclassical monocytes (Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR isotype), and release of massive amounts of calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9) in severe cases. Immature CD10LowCD101-CXCR4+/-neutrophils with an immunosuppressive profile accumulated in the blood and lungs, suggesting emergency myelopoiesis. Finally, we show that calprotectin plasma level and a routine flow cytometry assay detecting decreased frequencies of non-classical monocytes could discriminate patients who develop a severe form of COVID-19, suggesting a predictive value that deserves prospective evaluation.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-9221/result,E-MTAB-9221,1

Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) to over 8,000 human immunophenotypic blood cells from fetal liver and bone marrow. We inferred their differentiation trajectory and identified three highly proliferative oligopotent progenitor populations downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Along this trajectory, we observed opposing patterns of chromatin accessibility and differentiation that coincided with dynamic changes in the activity of distinct lineage-specific transcription factors. Integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression revealed extensive epigenetic but not transcriptional priming of HSCs/MPPs prior to their lineage commitment. Finally, we refined and functionally validated the sorting strategy for the HSCs/MPPs and achieved around 90% enrichment.

118,Distinct identities of leaf phloem cells revealed by single cell transcriptomics,"The leaf vasculature plays a key role in solute translocation. Veins consist of at least seven distinct cell types, with specific roles in transport, metabolism, and signaling. Little is known about leaf vascular cells, in particular the phloem parenchyma (PP). PP effluxes sucrose into the apoplasm as a basis for phloem loading, yet PP has been characterized only microscopically. Here, we enriched vascular cells from Arabidopsis leaves to generate a single-cell transcriptome atlas of leaf vasculature. We identified at least 19 cell clusters, encompassing epidermis, guard cells, hydathodes, mesophyll, and all vascular cell types, and used metabolic pathway analysis to define their roles. Clusters comprising PP cells were enriched for transporters, including SWEET11 and SWEET12 sucrose and UmamiT amino acid efflux carriers. We provide evidence that PP development occurs independently from ALTERED PHLOEM DEVELOPMENT, a transcription factor required for phloem differentiation. PP cells have a unique pattern of amino acid metabolism activity distinct from companion cells (CCs), explaining differential distribution/metabolism of amino acids in veins. The kinship relation of the vascular clusters is strikingly similar to the vein morphology, except for a clear separation of CC from the other vascular cells including PP. In summary, our single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis provides a wide range of information into the leaf vasculature and the role and relationship of the leaf cell types.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-161332/result,E-GEOD-161332,0

Tightly controlled interactions between structural and immune cells are required to maintain lung homeostasis. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to chart the cellular landscape of upper and lower airways and lung parenchyma in healthy lungs, and lower airways in asthmatic lungs. We report location-dependent airway epithelial cell states and a novel subset of tissue-resident memory T cells. In the lower airways of patients with asthma, mucous cell hyperplasia is shown to stem from a novel mucous ciliated cell state, as well as goblet cell hyperplasia. We report the presence of pathogenic effector type 2 helper T cells (TH2) in asthmatic lungs and find evidence for type 2 cytokines in maintaining the altered epithelial cell states.

Although fetal LGR5-expressing cells can give rise to adult intestinal stem cells3,4, it remains unclear whether this population in the patterned epithelium represents unique intestinal stem-cell precursors. Here we show, using unbiased quantitative lineage-tracing approaches, biophysical modelling and intestinal transplantation, that all cells of the mouse intestinal epithelium-irrespective of their location and pattern of LGR5 expression in the fetal gut tube-contribute actively to the adult intestinal stem cell pool. Using 3D imaging, we find that during fetal development the villus undergoes gross remodelling and fission. This brings epithelial cells from the non-proliferative villus into the proliferative intervillus region, which enables them to contribute to the adult stem-cell niche. Our results demonstrate that large-scale remodelling of the intestinal wall and cell-fate specification are closely linked. Moreover, these findings provide a direct link between the observed plasticity and cellular reprogramming of differentiating cells in adult tissues following damage5-9, revealing that stem-cell identity is an induced rather than a hardwired property.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7660/result,E-MTAB-7660,1
121,RNA-seq of coding RNA from single cells to assess the impact of aging on cell-to-cell transcriptional variability during immune stimulation,"Aging is characterized by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains unclear. We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated naÃ¯ve and effector memory CD4+T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core program and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-4888/result,E-MTAB-4888,1

Here, we used the high-throughput Drop-seq approach to profile >12,000 cells from Arabidopsis roots. This identified numerous distinct cell types, covering all major root tissues and developmental stages, and illuminated specific marker genes for these populations. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this approach to study the impact of environmental conditions on developmental processes. Analysis of roots grown with or without sucrose supplementation uncovers changes in the relative frequencies of cell types in response to sucrose. Finally, we characterize the transcriptome changes that occur across endodermis development and identify nearly 800 genes with dynamic expression as this tissue differentiates. Collectively, we demonstrate that single-cell RNA-seq can be used to profile developmental processes in plants and show how they can be altered by external stimuli.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-5/result,E-CURD-5,0

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 3,589 cells in a cohort of four patients. We obtained cells from the tumor core as well as surrounding peripheral tissue. Our analysis revealed cellular variation in the tumor's genome and transcriptome. We were also able to identify infiltrating neoplastic cells in regions peripheral to the core lesions. Despite the existence of significant heterogeneity among neoplastic cells, we found that infiltrating GBM cells share a consistent gene signature between patients, suggesting a common mechanism of infiltration. Additionally, in investigating the immunological response to the tumors, we found transcriptionally distinct myeloid cell populations residing in the tumor core and the surrounding peritumoral space.

We could define specific genetic programs for each individual endocrine and exocrine cell type, even for rare Î´, Î³, Îµ, and stellate cells, and revealed subpopulations of Î±, Î², and acinar cells. Intriguingly, Î´ cells expressed several important receptors, indicating an unrecognized importance of these cells in integrating paracrine and systemic metabolic signals. Genes previously associated with obesity or diabetes were found to correlate with BMI.

We also provide insight into pericyte organotypicity and define a population of perivascular fibroblast-like cells that are present on all vessel types except capillaries.

Although multiple studies have investigated the adipogenic stem and precursor cells that give rise to mature adipocytes3-14, our understanding of their in vivo origin and properties is incomplete2,15,16. This is partially due to the highly heterogeneous and unstructured nature of adipose tissue depots17, which has proven difficult to molecularly dissect using classical approaches such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Cre-lox lines based on candidate marker genes16,18. Here, using the resolving power of single-cell transcriptomics19in a mouse model, we reveal distinct subpopulations of adipose stem and precursor cells in the stromal vascular fraction of subcutaneous adipose tissue. We identify one of these subpopulations as CD142+adipogenesis-regulatory cells, which can suppress adipocyte formation in vivo and in vitro in a paracrine manner. We show that adipogenesis-regulatory cells are refractory to adipogenesis and that they are functionally conserved in humans. Our findings point to a potentially critical role for adipogenesis-regulatory cells in modulating adipose tissue plasticity, which is linked to metabolic control, differential insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6677/result,E-MTAB-6677,1

Here we establish fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-specific fate-mapping in mice to define their embryonic origin and differentiation trajectories. Our data show that all reticular cell subsets descend from multipotent progenitors emerging at embryonic day 19.5 from periarterial progenitors. Commitment of FRC progenitors is concluded during the first week of postnatal life through occupation of niches along developing central arterioles. Single cell transcriptomic analysis facilitated deconvolution of FRC differentiation trajectories and indicated that perivascular reticular cells function both as adult lymphoid organizer cells and mural cell progenitors. The lymphotoxin-Î² receptor-independent sustenance of postnatal progenitor stemness unveils that systemic immune surveillance in the splenic white pulp is governed through subset specification of reticular cells from a multipotent periarterial progenitor cell. In sum, the finding that discrete signaling events in perivascular niches determine the differentiation trajectories of reticular cell networks explains the development of distinct microenvironmental niches in secondary and tertiary lymphoid tissues that are crucial for the induction and regulation of innate and adaptive immune processes.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7094/result,E-MTAB-7094,1

These cortical interneurons are structurally and functionally diverse. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to study the origins of this diversity in the mouse. We identify distinct types of progenitor cells and newborn neurons in the ganglionic eminences, the embryonic proliferative regions that give rise to cortical interneurons. These embryonic precursors show temporally and spatially restricted transcriptional patterns that lead to different classes of interneurons in the adult cerebral cortex.

Because aging reflects a stochastic process of increasing disorder, cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways, thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult cells difficult to interpret. Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We find that islet endocrine cells from older donors display increased levels of transcriptional noise and potential fate drift. By determining the mutational history of individual cells, we uncover a novel mutational signature in healthy aging endocrine cells.

However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, and heterogeneity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4+memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in more than 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile, and clonality in humans. Single-cell differential gene expression analysis revealed a spectrum of known transcripts, including several linked to cytotoxic and costimulatory function that are expressed at higher levels in the TEMRA(effector memory T cells expressing CD45RA) subset, which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs, compared with CD4+T cells in the central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) subsets. Simultaneous T cell antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-TEMRAcells show marked clonal expansion compared with TCMand TEMcells and that most of CD4-TEMRAwere dengue virus (DENV)-specific in donors with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRAwas highly heterogeneous across donors, with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. We identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRAsubset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and, thus, could provide insights into the mechanisms that may be used to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-106540/result,E-GEOD-106540,1

In this neurodegeneration model, we discovered two molecularly distinct reactive microglia phenotypes that are typified by modules of co-regulated type I and type II interferon response genes, respectively.

135,Single cell RNA-seq of cancer stem cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia during the disease course,"Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics are ideally placed to unravel intratumoral heterogeneity and selective resistance of cancer stem cell (SC) subpopulations to molecularly targeted cancer therapies. However, current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches lack the sensitivity required to reliably detect somatic mutations. We developed a method that combines high-sensitivity mutation detection with whole-transcriptome analysis of the same single cell. We applied this technique to analyze more than 2,000 SCs from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) throughout the disease course, revealing heterogeneity of CML-SCs, including the identification of a subgroup of CML-SCs with a distinct molecular signature that selectively persisted during prolonged therapy. Analysis of nonleukemic SCs from patients with CML also provided new insights into cell-extrinsic disruption of hematopoiesis in CML associated with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we used this single-cell approach to identify a blast-crisis-specific SC population, which was also present in a subclone of CML-SCs during the chronic phase in a patient who subsequently developed blast crisis. This approach, which might be broadly applied to any malignancy, illustrates how single-cell analysis can identify subpopulations of therapy-resistant SCs that are not apparent through cell-population analysis.",developmental_biology;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-76312/result,E-GEOD-76312,1
136,Single-cell RNA-seq of long-term hematopoietic stem cells from young and aged mouse in response to inflammatory stress,"Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) maintain hematopoietic output throughout an animal's lifespan. With age, however, they produce a myeloid-biased output that may lead to poor immune responses to infectious challenge and the development of myeloid leukemias. Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is much more common amongst aged LT-HSCs and is uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict several transcription factors to regulate differentially expressed genes between mLT-HSCs and other LT-HSC subsets. Among these, we show that Klf5, Ikzf1 and Stat3 play important roles in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. These factors may regulate myeloid versus lymphoid balance with age, and can potentially mitigate the long-term deleterious effects of inflammation that lead to hematopoietic pathologies.",disease;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-100426/result,E-GEOD-100426,1
137,Single-cell RNA-Seq data of zebrafish blood cells,"The success of marker-based approaches for dissecting haematopoiesis in mouse and human is reliant on the presence of well-defined cell surface markers specific for diverse progenitor populations. An inherent problem with this approach is that the presence of specific cell surface markers does not directly reflect the transcriptional state of a cell. Here, we used a marker-free approach to computationally reconstruct the blood lineage tree in zebrafish and order cells along their differentiation trajectory, based on their global transcriptional differences. Within the population of transcriptionally similar stem and progenitor cells, our analysis reveals considerable cell-to-cell differences in their probability to transition to another committed state. Once fate decision is executed, the suppression of transcription of ribosomal genes and upregulation of lineage-specific factors coordinately controls lineage differentiation. Evolutionary analysis further demonstrates that this haematopoietic programme is highly conserved between zebrafish and higher vertebrates.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-5530/result,E-MTAB-5530,0

The lineage tracing data from Stmn1-CreERT2 shows that Stmn1+ cells in the corpus isthmus include fast dividing isthmus stem cells with long-term potency. On the other hand, chief cells including Lgr5+ subpopulation can play as quiescent stem cells in the base that are largely quiescent in homeostasis, but are activated upon injury.

140,Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells,"Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.",developmental_biology;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-81682/result,E-GEOD-81682,1
141,Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons,"The definition of neuronal type and how it relates to the transcriptome are open questions. Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) are among the best-characterized neuronal types: different PN classes target dendrites to distinct olfactory glomeruli, while PNs of the same class exhibit indistinguishable anatomical and physiological properties. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomes of most PN classes and unequivocally mapped transcriptomes to specific olfactory function for six classes. Transcriptomes of closely related PN classes exhibit the largest differences during circuit assembly but become indistinguishable in adults, suggesting that neuronal subtype diversity peaks during development. Transcription factors and cell-surface molecules are the most differentially expressed genes between classes and are highly informative in encoding cell identity, enabling us to identify a new lineage-specific transcription factor that instructs PN dendrite targeting. These findings establish that neuronal transcriptomic identity corresponds with anatomical and physiological identity defined by connectivity and function.",neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-100058/result,E-GEOD-100058,0

We constructed a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types, including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. We also analyzed cell type-specific mRNA processing and characterized genetic access to these transcriptomic types by many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of our transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby confirming that the single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be associated with specific cellular properties.",neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-71585/result,E-GEOD-71585,1

In vitro methods for interneuron generation hold promise for studying human cellular and functional properties and, ultimately, for therapeutic cell replacement. Here we describe a protocol for generating cortical interneurons from hESCs and analyze the properties and maturation time course of cell types using single-cell RNA-seq. We find that the cell types produced mimic in vivo temporal patterns of neuron and glial production, with immature progenitors and neurons observed early and mature cortical neurons and glial cell types produced late. By comparing the transcriptomes of immature interneurons to those of more mature neurons, we identified genes important for human interneuron differentiation.

We identified cell-type-specific genes and pathways as well as 245 genes with disturbed expression in type 2 diabetes. Importantly, 92% of the genes have not previously been associated with islet cell function or growth.

Here we report profiling of 53,193 individual epithelial cells from the small intestine and organoids of mice, which enabled the identification and characterization of previously unknown subtypes of intestinal epithelial cell and their gene signatures. We found unexpected diversity in hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells and constructed the taxonomy of newly identified subtypes, and distinguished between two subtypes of tuft cell, one of which expresses the epithelial cytokine Tslp and the pan-immune marker CD45, which was not previously associated with non-haematopoietic cells. We also characterized the ways in which cell-intrinsic states and the proportions of different cell types respond to bacterial and helminth infections: Salmonella infection caused an increase in the abundance of Paneth cells and enterocytes, and broad activation of an antimicrobial program; Heligmosomoides polygyrus caused an increase in the abundance of goblet and tuft cells.

We also provide insight into pericyte organotypicity and define a population of perivascular fibroblast-like cells that are present on all vessel types except capillaries.

147,Single cell analysis of human fetal liver captures the transcriptional profile of hepatobiliary hybrid progenitors,"The liver parenchyma is composed of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells (BECs). Controversy exists regarding the cellular origin of human liver parenchymal tissue generation during embryonic development, homeostasis or repair. Here we report the existence of a hepatobiliary hybrid progenitor (HHyP) population in human foetal liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. HHyPs are anatomically restricted to the ductal plate of foetal liver and maintain a transcriptional profile distinct from foetal hepatocytes, mature hepatocytes and mature BECs. In addition, molecular heterogeneity within the EpCAM+population of freshly isolated foetal and adult human liver identifies diverse gene expression signatures of hepatic and biliary lineage potential. Finally, we FACS isolate foetal HHyPs and confirm their hybrid progenitor phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that hepatobiliary progenitor cells previously identified in mice also exist in humans, and can be distinguished from other parenchymal populations, including mature BECs, by distinct gene expression profiles.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-130473/result,E-GEOD-130473,1

149,Single-cell RNA-seq of naive and primed human embryonic stem cells,"Background:Population phenotypic variation can arise from genetic differences between individuals, or from cellular heterogeneity in an isogenic group of cells or organisms. The emergence of gene expression differences between genetically identical cells is referred to as gene expression noise, the sources of which are not well understood.Results:In this work, by studying gene expression noise between multiple cell lineages and mammalian species, we find consistent evidence of a role for CpG islands as sources of gene expression noise. Variation in noise among CpG island promoters can be partially attributed to differences in island size, in which short islands have noisier gene expression. Building on these findings, we investigate the potential for short CpG islands to act as fast response elements to environmental stimuli. Specifically, we find that these islands are enriched amongst primary response genes in SWI/SNF-independent stimuli, suggesting that expression noise is an indicator of promoter responsiveness.Conclusions:Thus, through the integration of single-cell RNA expression profiling, chromatin landscape and temporal gene expression dynamics, we have uncovered a role for short CpG island promoters as fast response elements.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6819/result,E-MTAB-6819,1
150,snRNA-seq of whole hearts from adult BL6 mice,"The recent development and broad application of sequencing techniques at the single-cell level is generating an unprecedented amount of data. The different techniques have their individual limits, but the datasets also offer unexpected possibilities when utilized collectively. Here, we applied snRNA-seq in whole adult murine hearts from an inbred (C57BL/6NRj) and an outbred (Fzt:DU) mouse strain to directly compare the data with the publicly available scRNA-seq data of the tabula muris project. Explicitly choosing a single-nucleus approach allowed us to pin down the typical heart tissue-specific technical bias, coming up with novel insights on the mammalian heart cell composition. For our integrated dataset, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells constituted the three main cell populations accounting for about 75% of all cells. However, their numbers severely differed between the individual datasets, with cardiomyocyte proportions ranging from about 9% in the tabula muris data to around 23% for our BL6 data, representing the prime example for cell capture technique related bias when using a conventional single-cell approach for these large cells. Most strikingly in our comparison was the discovery of a minor population of cardiomyocytes characterized by proliferation markers that could not be identified by analyzing the datasets individually. It is now widely accepted that the heart has an, albeit very restricted, regenerative potential. However there is still an ongoing debate where new cardiomyocytes arise from. Our findings support the idea that the renewal of the cardiomyocyte pool is driven by cytokinesis of resident cardiomyocytes rather than differentiation of progenitor cells. We thus provide data that can contribute to an understanding of heart cell regeneration, which is a prerequisite for future applications to enhance the process of heart repair.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8848/result,E-MTAB-8848,1
151,Single cell transcriptomics defines human islet cell signatures and reveals cell-type-specific expression changes in type 2 diabetes,"Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of at least four cell types constituting pancreatic islets. Changes in the proportion and/or function of these cells are associated with genetic and molecular pathophysiology of monogenic, type 1, and type 2 (T2D) diabetes. Cellular heterogeneity impedes precise understanding of the molecular components of each islet cell type that govern islet (dys)function, particularly the less abundant delta and gamma/pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. Here, we report single-cell transcriptomes for 638 cells from nondiabetic (ND) and T2D human islet samples. Analyses of ND single-cell transcriptomes identified distinct alpha, beta, delta, and PP/gamma cell-type signatures. Genes linked to rare and common forms of islet dysfunction and diabetes were expressed in the delta and PP/gamma cell types. Moreover, this study revealed that delta cells specifically express receptors that receive and coordinate systemic cues from the leptin, ghrelin, and dopamine signaling pathways implicating them as integrators of central and peripheral metabolic signals into the pancreatic islet. Finally, single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed genes differentially regulated between T2D and ND alpha, beta, and delta cells that were undetectable in paired whole islet analyses. This study thus identifies fundamental cell-type-specific features of pancreatic islet (dys)function and provides a critical resource for comprehensive understanding of islet biology and diabetes pathogenesis.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-27/result,E-ENAD-27,1

Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identified a distinct subpopulation of old HSCs carrying a p53 signature indicative of stem cell decline alongside pro-proliferative JAK/STAT signaling. To investigate the relationship between JAK/STAT and p53 signaling, we challenged HSCs with a constitutively active form of JAK2 (V617F) and observed an expansion of the p53-positive subpopulation in old mice. Our results reveal cellular heterogeneity in the onset of HSC aging and implicate a role for JAK2V617F-driven proliferation in the p53-mediated functional decline of old HSCs.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-87631/result,E-GEOD-87631,1

Single-cell transcriptomes of âˆ¼13,000 habenular cells with 4Ã— cellular coverage identified 18 neuronal types and dozens of marker genes. Registration of marker genes onto a reference atlas created a resource for anatomical and functional studies and enabled the mapping of active neurons onto neuronal types following aversive stimuli.

154,Single-cell RNA-seq of purified populations of stem cells and transit-amplifying cells of hair follicles,"Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which, through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single-cell RNA-seq, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage tracing, temporal single-cell analyses, and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged unilineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: some progenitors specify lineages immediately, whereas others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-90848/result,E-GEOD-90848,1

We profiled 14,080 individual cells from the gut of wild-type zebrafish, as well as ofrag1-deficient zebrafish that lack T and B cells, and discovered populations of ILC-like cells. We uncovered arorc-positive subset of ILCs that could express cytokines associated with type 1, 2, and 3 responses upon immune challenge. Specifically, these ILC-like cells expressedil22andtnfaafter exposure to inactivated bacteria oril13after exposure to helminth extract.

However, the study of these interplays at the molecular level remains challenging due to the lack of efficient methods allowing cell cycle synchronization of large quantities of cells. Here, we screened inhibitors of cell cycle progression and identified nocodazole as the most efficient small molecule to synchronize hPSCs in the G2/M phase. Following nocodazole treatment, hPSCs remain pluripotent, retain a normal karyotype and can successfully differentiate into the three germ layers and functional cell types. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptomic analyses on single cells synchronized for their cell cycle and differentiated toward the endoderm lineage validated our findings and showed that nocodazole treatment has no effect on gene expression during the differentiation process. Thus, our synchronization method provides a robust approach to study cell cycle mechanisms in hPSCs.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7008/result,E-MTAB-7008,1
157,Single-cell RNA-seq reveals differentiation hierarchy of normal human bone marrow and a distinct transcriptome signature of aneuploid cells,"Cancer cells frequently exhibit chromosomal abnormalities. Specific cytogenetic aberrations often are predictors of outcome, especially in hematologic neoplasms, such as monosomy 7 in myeloid malignancies. The functional consequences of aneuploidy at the cellular level are difficult to assess because of a lack of convenient markers to distinguish abnormal from diploid cells. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow of 4 healthy donors and 5 patients with bone marrow failure and chromosome gain or loss. In total, transcriptome sequences were obtained from 391 control cells and 588 cells from patients. We characterized normal hematopoiesis as binary differentiation from stem cells to erythroid and myeloid-lymphoid pathways. Aneuploid cells were distinguished from diploid cells in patient samples by computational analyses of read fractions and gene expression of individual chromosomes. We confirmed assignment of aneuploidy to individual cells quantitatively, by copy-number variation, and qualitatively, by loss of heterozygosity. When we projected patients' single cells onto the map of normal hematopoiesis, diverse patterns were observed, broadly reflecting clinical phenotypes. Patients' monosomy 7 cells showed downregulation of genes involved in immune response and DNA damage checkpoint and apoptosis pathways, which may contribute to the clonal expansion of monosomy 7 cells with accumulated gene mutations. scRNA-seq is a powerful technique through which to infer the functional consequences of chromosome gain and loss and explore gene targets for directed therapy.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-6/result,E-CURD-6,1
158,Single-cell transcriptional profiling of induced reprogramming trajectories,"Understanding how cell identity transitions occur and whether there are multiple paths between the same beginning and end states are questions of wide interest. Here we show that acquisition of naive pluripotency can follow transcriptionally and mechanistically distinct routes. Starting from post-implantation epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), one route advances through a mesodermal state prior to naive pluripotency induction, whereas another transiently resembles the early inner cell mass and correspondingly gains greater developmental potency. These routes utilize distinct signaling networks and transcription factors but subsequently converge on the same naive endpoint, showing surprising flexibility in mechanisms underlying identity transitions and suggesting that naive pluripotency is a multidimensional attractor state. These route differences are reconciled by precise expression of Oct4 as a unifying, essential, and sufficient feature. We propose that fine-tuned regulation of this ""transition factor"" underpins multidimensional access to naive pluripotency, offering a conceptual framework for understanding cell identity transitions.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7901/result,E-MTAB-7901,1

In this study, we show that pre-cDCs in humans are heterogeneous, consisting of two distinct populations of precursors that are precommitted to become either CD1c+or CD141+cDCs. The two groups of lineage-primed precursors can be distinguished based on differential expression of CD172a. Both subpopulations of pre-cDCs arise in the adult bone marrow and can be found in cord blood and adult peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis revealed that CD172a+and CD172a-pre-cDCs represent developmentally discrete populations that differentially express lineage-restricted transcription factors. A clinical trial of Flt3L injection revealed that this cytokine increases the number of both CD172a-and CD172a+pre-cDCs in human peripheral blood.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-89232/result,E-GEOD-89232,1

162,Single-cell RNA sequencing of spleen-derived LCK-expressing cells from adult zebrafish,"The immune system of vertebrate species consists of many different cell types that have distinct functional roles and are subject to different evolutionary pressures. Here, we first analyzed conservation of genes specific for all major immune cell types in human and mouse. Our results revealed higher gene turnover and faster evolution oftrans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared with other immune cell types, and especially T cells, but similar conservation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein coding genes. To validate these findings in a distant vertebrate species, we used single-cell RNA sequencing oflck:GFPcells in zebrafish and obtained the first transcriptome of specific immune cell types in a nonmammalian species. Unsupervised clustering and single-cellTCRlocus reconstruction identified three cell populations, T cells, a novel type of NK-like cells, and a smaller population of myeloid-like cells. Differential expression analysis uncovered new immune-cell-specific genes, including novel immunoglobulin-like receptors, and neofunctionalization of recently duplicated paralogs. Evolutionary analyses confirmed the higher gene turnover oftrans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared with T cells in fish species, suggesting that this is a general property of immune cell types across all vertebrates.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-4617/result,E-MTAB-4617,0
163,Single-cell RNA sequencing of self-maintaining lamina propria macrophages,"Macrophages are highly heterogeneous tissue-resident immune cells that perform a variety of tissue-supportive functions. The current paradigm dictates that intestinal macrophages are continuously replaced by incoming monocytes that acquire a pro-inflammatory or tissue-protective signature. Here, we identify a self-maintaining population of macrophages that arise from both embryonic precursors and adult bone marrow-derived monocytes and persists throughout adulthood. Gene expression and imaging studies of self-maintaining macrophages revealed distinct transcriptional profiles that reflect their unique localization (i.e., closely positioned to blood vessels, submucosal and myenteric plexus, Paneth cells, and Peyer's patches). Depletion of self-maintaining macrophages resulted in morphological abnormalities in the submucosal vasculature and loss of enteric neurons, leading to vascular leakage, impaired secretion, and reduced intestinal motility. These results provide critical insights in intestinal macrophage heterogeneity and demonstrate the strategic role of self-maintaining macrophages in gut homeostasis and intestinal physiology.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6976/result,E-MTAB-6976,1

Here, we used single-cell sequencing of precisely staged embryos and devised DistMap, a computational mapping strategy to reconstruct the embryo and to predict spatial gene expression approaching single-cell resolution. We produced a virtual embryo with about 8000 expressed genes per cell. Our interactiveDrosophilaVirtual Expression eXplorer (DVEX) database generates three-dimensional virtual in situ hybridizations and computes gene expression gradients. We used DVEX to uncover patterned expression of transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs, as well as signaling pathway components. Spatial regulation of Hippo signaling during early embryogenesis suggests a mechanism for establishing asynchronous cell proliferation.

165,Human cerebral organoids recapitulate gene expression programs of fetal neocortex development,"Cerebral organoids-3D cultures of human cerebral tissue derived from pluripotent stem cells-have emerged as models of human cortical development. However, the extent to which in vitro organoid systems recapitulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation programs observed in vivo remains unclear. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect and compare cell composition and progenitor-to-neuron lineage relationships in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. Covariation network analysis using the fetal neocortex data reveals known and previously unidentified interactions among genes central to neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In the organoid, we detect diverse progenitors and differentiated cell types of neuronal and mesenchymal lineages and identify cells that derived from regions resembling the fetal neocortex. We find that these organoid cortical cells use gene expression programs remarkably similar to those of the fetal tissue to organize into cerebral cortex-like regions. Our comparison of in vivo and in vitro cortical single-cell transcriptomes illuminates the genetic features underlying human cortical development that can be studied in organoid cultures.",neuroscience,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-75140/result,E-GEOD-75140,1

167,Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of a patient-derived xenograft model before and after treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors,"Many patients with advanced cancers achieve dramatic responses to a panoply of therapeutics yet retain minimal residual disease (MRD), which ultimately results in relapse. To gain insights into the biology of MRD, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to malignant cells isolated from BRAF mutant patient-derived xenograft melanoma cohorts exposed to concurrent RAF/MEK-inhibition. We identified distinct drug-tolerant transcriptional states, varying combinations of which co-occurred within MRDs from PDXs and biopsies of patients on treatment. One of these exhibited a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) transcriptional program largely driven by the nuclear receptor RXRG. An RXR antagonist mitigated accumulation of NCSCs in MRD and delayed the development of resistance. These data identify NCSCs as key drivers of resistance and illustrate the therapeutic potential of MRD-directed therapy. They also highlight how gene regulatory network architecture reprogramming may be therapeutically exploited to limit cellular heterogeneity, a key driver of disease progression and therapy resistance.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-20/result,E-ENAD-20,1

We used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile 430 cells from five primary glioblastomas, which we found to be inherently variable in their expression of diverse transcriptional programs related to oncogenic signaling, proliferation, complement/immune response, and hypoxia. We also observed a continuum of stemness-related expression states that enabled us to identify putative regulators of stemness in vivo. Finally, we show that established glioblastoma subtype classifiers are variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor and demonstrate the potential prognostic implications of such intratumoral heterogeneity. Thus, we reveal previously unappreciated heterogeneity in diverse regulatory programs central to glioblastoma biology, prognosis, and therapy.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-17/result,E-ENAD-17,1

Unbiased transcriptional clustering revealed four distinct populations, corresponding to ILC1 cells, ILC2 cells, ILC3 cells and NK cells, with their respective transcriptomes recapitulating known as well as unknown transcriptional profiles. The single-cell resolution additionally divulged three transcriptionally and functionally diverse subpopulations of ILC3 cells.

To facilitate the detection of rare cellular states and uncover population heterogeneity, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on islets from multiple deceased organ donors, including children, healthy adults, and individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We developed a robust computational biology framework for cell type annotation. Using this framework, we show that Î±- and Î²-cells from children exhibit less well-defined gene signatures than those in adults. Remarkably, Î±- and Î²-cells from donors with type 2 diabetes have expression profiles with features seen in children, indicating a partial dedifferentiation process. We also examined a naturally proliferating Î±-cell from a healthy adult, for which pathway analysis indicated activation of the cell cycle and repression of checkpoint control pathways. Importantly, this replicating Î±-cell exhibited activated Sonic hedgehog signaling, a pathway not previously known to contribute to human Î±-cell proliferation.

In naive T cells, the inherent effect of ligand strength on activation pathways and endpoints has remained controversial, confounded by environmental fluctuations and intercellular variability within populations. Here we studied how ligand potency affected the activation of CD8+T cells in vitro, through the use of genome-wide RNA, multi-dimensional protein and functional measurements in single cells. Our data revealed that strong ligands drove more efficient and uniform activation than did weak ligands, but all activated cells were fully cytolytic. Notably, activation followed the same transcriptional pathways regardless of ligand potency. Thus, stimulation strength did not intrinsically dictate the T cell-activation route or phenotype; instead, it controlled how rapidly and simultaneously the cells initiated activation, allowing limited machinery to elicit wide-ranging responses.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6051/result,E-MTAB-6051,1
173,Single cell sequencing of iPSC-dopamine neurons reconstructs disease progression and identifies HDAC4 as a regulator of Parkinson cell phenotypes,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons provide an opportunity to model Parkinson's disease (PD), but neuronal cultures are confounded by asynchronous and heterogeneous appearance of disease phenotypes in vitro. Using high-resolution, single-cell transcriptomic analyses of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons carrying the GBA-N370S PD risk variant, we identified a progressive axis of gene expression variation leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Pseudotime analysis of genes differentially expressed (DE) along this axis identified the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) as an upstream regulator of disease progression. HDAC4 was mislocalized to the nucleus in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons and repressed genes early in the disease axis, leading to late deficits in protein homeostasis. Treatment of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons with HDAC4-modulating compounds upregulated genes early in the DE axis and corrected PD-related cellular phenotypes. Our study demonstrates how single-cell transcriptomics can exploit cellular heterogeneity to reveal disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7303/result,E-MTAB-7303,1
174,A versatile approach for assessing human stem cell-derived retinal progeny using single cell transcriptomics,"Cell type-specific investigations commonly use gene reporters or single-cell analytical techniques. However, reporter line development is arduous and generally limited to a single gene of interest, while single-cell RNA (scRNA)-sequencing (seq) frequently yields equivocal results that preclude definitive cell identification. To examine gene expression profiles of multiple retinal cell types derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we performed scRNA-seq on optic vesicle (OV)-like structures cultured under cGMP-compatible conditions. However, efforts to apply traditional scRNA-seq analytical methods based on unbiased algorithms were unrevealing. Therefore, we developed a simple, versatile, and universally applicable approach that generates gene expression data akin to those obtained from reporter lines. This method ranks single cells by expression level of a bait gene and searches the transcriptome for genes whose cell-to-cell rank order expression most closely matches that of the bait. Moreover, multiple bait genes can be combined to refine datasets. Using this approach, we provide further evidence for the authenticity of hPSC-derived retinal cell types.

Here we adopt this powerful approach to breast cancer and analyse 515 cells from 11 patients. Inferred copy number variations from the single-cell RNA-seq data separate carcinoma cells from non-cancer cells. At a single-cell resolution, carcinoma cells display common signatures within the tumour as well as intratumoral heterogeneity regarding breast cancer subtype and crucial cancer-related pathways. Most of the non-cancer cells are immune cells, with three distinct clusters of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages. T lymphocytes and macrophages both display immunosuppressive characteristics: T cells with a regulatory or an exhausted phenotype and macrophages with an M2 phenotype. These results illustrate that the breast cancer transcriptome has a wide range of intratumoral heterogeneity, which is shaped by the tumour cells and immune cells in the surrounding microenvironment.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-75688/result,E-GEOD-75688,1
176,Single cell RNA-seq of human lung epithelial cells from 3 control and 6 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patient samples,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal interstitial lung disease characterized by airway remodeling, inflammation, alveolar destruction, and fibrosis. We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify epithelial cell types and associated biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Transcriptomic analysis of normal human lung epithelial cells defined gene expression patterns associated with highly differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, indicated by enrichment of RNAs critical for surfactant homeostasis. In contrast, scRNA-seq of IPF cells identified 3 distinct subsets of epithelial cell types with characteristics of conducting airway basal and goblet cells and an additional atypical transitional cell that contributes to pathological processes in IPF. Individual IPF cells frequently coexpressed alveolar type 1 (AT1), AT2, and conducting airway selective markers, demonstrating ""indeterminate"" states of differentiation not seen in normal lung development. Pathway analysis predicted aberrant activation of canonical signaling via TGF-Î², HIPPO/YAP, P53, WNT, and AKT/PI3K. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy identified the disruption of alveolar structure and loss of the normal proximal-peripheral differentiation of pulmonary epithelial cells. scRNA-seq analyses identified loss of normal epithelial cell identities and unique contributions of epithelial cells to the pathogenesis of IPF.

Here, we perform the first single-cell transcriptome analysis of cranial neural crest cell migration at three progressive stages in chick and identify and establish hierarchical relationships between cell position and time-specific transcriptional signatures. We determine a novel transcriptional signature of the most invasive neural crest Trailblazer cells that is consistent during migration and enriched for approximately 900 genes. Knockdown of several Trailblazer genes shows significant but modest changes to total distance migrated. However, in vivo expression analysis by RNAscope and immunohistochemistry reveals some salt and pepper patterns that include strong individual Trailblazer gene expression in cells within other subregions of the migratory stream.

Transcriptional variation in unicellular malaria parasites from thePlasmodiumgenus is associated with critical phenotypes including red blood cell invasion and immune evasion, yet transcriptional variation at an individual parasite level has not been examined in depth. Here, we describe the adaptation of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol to deconvolute transcriptional variation for more than 500 individual parasites of both rodent and human malaria comprising asexual and sexual life-cycle stages. We uncover previously hidden discrete transcriptional signatures during the pathogenic part of the life cycle, suggesting that expression over development is not as continuous as commonly thought.

Inferred transcriptional burst kinetics revealed the genomic encoding of transcriptional burst frequencies and sizes within the genome. Core promoter elements were found to specify burst sizes, whereas burst frequencies were regulated by enhancers. In particular burst frequencies were found to account for cell-type differences in gene expression levels and were also mostly correlating with absolute expression levels in cells. Importantly, the patterns identified were not detectable at the level of mean expression demonstrating the need to investigate transcriptional dynamics at the level of burst kinetics.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7098/result,E-MTAB-7098,1

Here we demonstrated that lympho-myeloid progenitor populations in cord blood - lymphoid-primed multi-potential progenitors (LMPPs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and multi-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs) - were functionally and transcriptionally distinct and heterogeneous at the clonal level, with progenitors of many different functional potentials present. Although most progenitors had the potential to develop into only one mature cell type ('uni-lineage potential'), bi- and rarer multi-lineage progenitors were present among LMPPs, GMPs and MLPs. Those findings, coupled with single-cell expression analyses, suggest that a continuum of progenitors execute lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, rather than only uni-lineage progenitors' being present downstream of stem cells.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-100618/result,E-GEOD-100618,1

Here we report profiling of 53,193 individual epithelial cells from the small intestine and organoids of mice, which enabled the identification and characterization of previously unknown subtypes of intestinal epithelial cell and their gene signatures. We found unexpected diversity in hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells and constructed the taxonomy of newly identified subtypes, and distinguished between two subtypes of tuft cell, one of which expresses the epithelial cytokine Tslp and the pan-immune marker CD45, which was not previously associated with non-haematopoietic cells. We also characterized the ways in which cell-intrinsic states and the proportions of different cell types respond to bacterial and helminth infections: Salmonella infection caused an increase in the abundance of Paneth cells and enterocytes, and broad activation of an antimicrobial program; Heligmosomoides polygyrus caused an increase in the abundance of goblet and tuft cells.

183,The Global Molecular Landscape of dormant Hematopoietic Stem Cells,"Dormant hematopoietic stem cells (dHSCs) are atop the hematopoietic hierarchy. The molecular identity of dHSCs and the mechanisms regulating their maintenance or exit from dormancy remain uncertain. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to show that the transition from dormancy toward cell-cycle entry is a continuous developmental path associated with upregulation of biosynthetic processes rather than a stepwise progression. In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc. Mice maintained on a vitamin A-free diet lose HSCs and show a disrupted re-entry into dormancy after exposure to inflammatory stress stimuli. Our results highlight the impact of dietary vitamin A on the regulation of cell-cycle-mediated stem cell plasticity.

184,Single cell RNA sequencing of putative AIRE+ dendritic cells from human paediatric tonsillitis,"Expression of the Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) outside of the thymus has long been suggested in both humans and mice, but the cellular source in humans has remained undefined. Here we identify AIRE expression in human tonsils and extensively analyzed these ""extra-thymic AIRE expressing cells"" (eTACs) using combinations of flow cytometry, CyTOF and single cell RNA-sequencing. We identified AIRE+ cells as dendritic cells (DCs) with a mature and migratory phenotype including high levels of antigen presenting molecules and costimulatory molecules, and specific expression of CD127, CCR7, and PDL1. These cells also possessed the ability to stimulate and re-stimulate T cells and displayed reduced responses to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists compared to conventional DCs. While expression ofAIREwas enriched within CCR7+CD127+ DCs, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed expression ofAIREto be transient, rather than stable, and associated with the differentiation to a mature phenotype. The role of AIRE in central tolerance induction within the thymus is well-established, however our study shows thatAIREexpression within the periphery is not associated with an enriched expression of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs). This unexpected finding, suggestive of wider functions of AIRE, may provide an explanation for the non-autoimmune symptoms of APECED patients who lack functional AIRE.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7381/result,E-MTAB-7381,1

It is an important regulator of systemic metabolism, as shown by the fact that dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity leads to a variety of secondary metabolic complications2,3. In addition, adipose tissue functions as a signalling hub that regulates systemic metabolism through paracrine and endocrine signals4. Here we use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis in mice and humans to characterize adipocyte heterogeneity. We identify a rare subpopulation of adipocytes in mice that increases in abundance at higher temperatures, and we show that this subpopulation regulates the activity of neighbouring adipocytes through acetate-mediated modulation of their thermogenic capacity. Human adipose tissue contains higher numbers of cells of this subpopulation, which could explain the lower thermogenic activity of human compared to mouse adipose tissue and suggests that targeting this pathway could be used to restore thermogenic activity.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-8561/result,E-MTAB-8561,1

They generate functional cell types of neural crest and CNS lineages and could be used to model a human pain syndrome via gene editing of SCN9A in iNBSCs. NBSCs can also be derived from human pluripotent stem cells and share functional and molecular features with NBSCs isolated from embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) mouse neural folds. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified the anterior hindbrain as the origin of mouse NBSCs, with human iNBSCs sharing a similar regional identity.

This in-vitro differentiation process generates a heterogeneous population with a proportion of cells failing to differentiate properly and maintaining expression of pluripotency factors such as Oct4. RNA sequencing of single cells collected at four time points during a 4-day DE differentiation identified high expression of metallothionein genes in the residual Oct4-positive cells that failed to differentiate to DE. Using X-ray fluorescence microscopy and multi-isotope mass spectrometry, we discovered that high intracellular zinc level corresponds with persistent Oct4 expression and failure to differentiate.

190,Deciphering the relationship between polycomb repression and stochastic gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq data,"Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) are important histone modifiers, which silence gene expression; yet, there exists a subset of PRC-bound genes actively transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). It is likely that the role of Polycomb repressive complex is to dampen expression of these PRC-active genes. However, it is unclear how this flipping between chromatin states alters the kinetics of transcription. Here, we integrate histone modifications and RNAPII states derived from bulk ChIP-seq data with single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We find that Polycomb repressive complex-active genes have greater cell-to-cell variation in expression than active genes, and these results are validated by knockout experiments. We also show that PRC-active genes are clustered on chromosomes in both two and three dimensions, and interactions with active enhancers promote a stabilization of gene expression noise. These findings provide new insights into how chromatin regulation modulates stochastic gene expression and transcriptional bursting, with implications for regulation of pluripotency and development.Polycomb repressive complexes modify histones but it is unclear how changes in chromatin states alter kinetics of transcription.

Although multiple studies have investigated the adipogenic stem and precursor cells that give rise to mature adipocytes3-14, our understanding of their in vivo origin and properties is incomplete2,15,16. This is partially due to the highly heterogeneous and unstructured nature of adipose tissue depots17, which has proven difficult to molecularly dissect using classical approaches such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Cre-lox lines based on candidate marker genes16,18. Here, using the resolving power of single-cell transcriptomics19in a mouse model, we reveal distinct subpopulations of adipose stem and precursor cells in the stromal vascular fraction of subcutaneous adipose tissue. We identify one of these subpopulations as CD142+adipogenesis-regulatory cells, which can suppress adipocyte formation in vivo and in vitro in a paracrine manner. We show that adipogenesis-regulatory cells are refractory to adipogenesis and that they are functionally conserved in humans.

194,Single Cell Sequencing Reveals Gene Expression Signatures Associated with Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Subpopulations and Time in Culture [scRNA-seq],"Background:Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are a heterogeneous population that participates in wound healing, immune modulation and tissue regeneration. Next generation sequencing was used to analyze transcripts from single BMSCs in order to better characterize BMSC subpopulations.Methods:Cryopreserved passage 2 BMSCs from one healthy subject were cultured through passage 10. The transcriptomes of bulk BMSCs from designated passages were analyzed with microarrays and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). For some passages, single BMSCs were separated using microfluidics and their transcriptomes were analyzed by RNA-Seq.Results:Transcriptome analysis by microarray and RNA-Seq of unseparated BMSCs from passages 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 yielded similar results; both data sets grouped passages 4 and 6 and passages 9 and 10 together and genes differentially expressed among these early and late passage BMSCs were similar. 3D Diffusion map visualization of single BMSCs from passages 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 clustered passages 3 and 9 into two distinct groups, but there was considerable overlap for passages 4, 6 and 8 cells. Markers for early passage, FGFR2, and late passage BMSCs, PLAT, were able to identify three subpopulations within passage 3 BMSCs; one that expressed high levels of FGFR2 and low levels of PLAT; one that expressed low levels of FGFR2 and high levels of PLAT and one that expressed intermediate levels of FGFR2 and low levels of PLAT.Conclusions:Single BMSCs can be separated by microfluidics and their transcriptome analyzed by next generation sequencing. Single cell analysis of early passage BMSCs identified a subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of FGFR2 that might include skeletal stem cells.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-124858/result,E-GEOD-124858,1
195,Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of kidney marrow from six zebrafish transgenic lines that label specific blood cell types,"Recent advances in single-cell, transcriptomic profiling have provided unprecedented access to investigate cell heterogeneity during tissue and organ development. In this study, we used massively parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing to define cell heterogeneity within the zebrafish kidney marrow, constructing a comprehensive molecular atlas of definitive hematopoiesis and functionally distinct renal cells found in adult zebrafish. Because our method analyzed blood and kidney cells in an unbiased manner, our approach was useful in characterizing immune-cell deficiencies within DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit (prkdc), interleukin-2 receptor Î³ a (il2rga), and double-homozygous-mutant fish, identifying blood cell losses in T, B, and natural killer cells within specific genetic mutants. Our analysis also uncovered novel cell types, including two classes of natural killer immune cells, classically defined and erythroid-primed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, mucin-secreting kidney cells, and kidney stem/progenitor cells. In total, our work provides the first, comprehensive, single-cell, transcriptomic analysis of kidney and marrow cells in the adult zebrafish.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-100911/result,E-GEOD-100911,0
196,"Single cell RNA-seq of three human melanoma cell lines: Ma-Mel-123, Ma-Mel-108 and Ma-Mel-93","Recent technological advances in single-cell genomics make it possible to analyze cellular heterogeneity of tumor samples. Here, we applied single-cell RNA-seq to measure the transcriptomes of 307 single cells cultured from three biopsies of three different patients with a BRAF/NRAS wild type, BRAF mutant/NRAS wild type and BRAF wild type/NRAS mutant melanoma metastasis, respectively. Analysis based on self-organizing maps identified sub-populations defined by multiple gene expression modules involved in proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation, pigmentation and cellular stroma. Gene expression modules had prognostic relevance when compared with gene expression data from published melanoma samples and patient survival data. We surveyed kinome expression patterns across sub-populations of the BRAF/NRAS wild type sample and found that CDK4 and CDK2 were consistently highly expressed in the majority of cells, suggesting that these kinases might be involved in melanoma progression. Treatment of cells with the CDK4 inhibitor palbociclib restricted cell proliferation to a similar, and in some cases greater, extent than MAPK inhibitors. Finally, we identified a low abundant sub-population in this sample that highly expressed a module containing ABC transporter ABCB5, surface markers CD271 and CD133, and multiple aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). Patient-derived cultures of the BRAF mutant/NRAS wild type and BRAF wild type/NRAS mutant metastases showed more homogeneous single-cell gene expression patterns with gene expression modules for proliferation and ABC transporters. Taken together, our results describe an intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity in melanoma short-term cultures which might be relevant for patient survival, and suggest promising targets for new treatment approaches in melanoma therapy.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-81383/result,E-GEOD-81383,1

Transcriptional variation in unicellular malaria parasites from the Plasmodium genus is associated with critical phenotypes including red blood cell invasion and immune evasion, yet transcriptional variation at an individual parasite level has not been examined in depth. Here, we describe the adaptation of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol to deconvolute transcriptional variation for more than 500 individual parasites of both rodent and human malaria comprising asexual and sexual life-cycle stages. We uncover previously hidden discrete transcriptional signatures during the pathogenic part of the life cycle, suggesting that expression over development is not as continuous as commonly thought.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on the mouse embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), the major birthplace for CINs, and on MGE-like cells differentiated from embryonic stem cells. Two distinct cell types were identified as proliferating neural progenitors and immature neurons, both of which comprised sub-populations. Although lineage development of MGE progenitors was reconstructed and immature neurons were characterized as GABAergic, cells that might correspond to precursors of different CINs were not identified. A few non-neuronal cell types were detected, including microglia. In vitro MGE-like cells resembled bona fide MGE cells but expressed lower levels of Foxg1 and Epha4. Together, our data provide detailed understanding of the embryonic MGE developmental program and suggest how CINs are specified.",neuroscience;developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-94641/result,E-GEOD-94641,1
199,Single-cell transcriptomes of each cell of the C. elegans embryo until the 16-cell stage,"During embryonic development, cells must establish fates, morphologies, and behaviors in coordination with one another to form a functional body. A prevalent hypothesis for how this coordination is achieved is that each cell's fate and behavior is determined by a defined mixture of RNAs. Only recently has it become possible to measure the full suite of transcripts in a single cell. Here we quantify genome-wide mRNA abundance in each cell of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo up to the 16-cell stage. We describe spatially dynamic expression, quantify cell-specific differential activation of the zygotic genome, and identify genes that were previously unappreciated as being critical for development. We present an interactive data visualization tool that allows broad access to our dataset. This genome-wide single-cell map of mRNA abundance, alongside the well-studied life history and fate of each cell, describes at a cellular resolution the mRNA landscape that guides development.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-77944/result,E-GEOD-77944,0

CD8+T cells confer cross-protection against IAV strains, however the responses of CD8+T cells to IBV and ICV are understudied. We investigated the breadth of CD8+T cell cross-recognition and provide evidence of CD8+T cell cross-reactivity across IAV, IBV and ICV. We identified immunodominant CD8+T cell epitopes from IBVs that were protective in mice and found memory CD8+T cells directed against universal and influenza-virus-type-specific epitopes in the blood and lungs of healthy humans. Lung-derived CD8+T cells displayed tissue-resident memory phenotypes. Notably, CD38+Ki67+CD8+effector T cells directed against novel epitopes were readily detected in IAV- or IBV-infected pediatric and adult subjects. Our study introduces a new paradigm whereby CD8+T cells confer unprecedented cross-reactivity across all influenza viruses, a key finding for the design of universal vaccines.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7606/result,E-MTAB-7606,1
201,Single-cell sequencing of stage 4 chicken embryos,"During vertebrate development, progenitor cells give rise to tissues and organs through a complex choreography that commences at gastrulation. A hallmark event of gastrulation is the formation of the primitive streak, a linear assembly of cells along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the developing organism. To examine the primitive streak at a single-cell resolution, we measured the transcriptomes of individual chick cells from the streak or the surrounding tissue (the rest of the area pellucida) in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 4 embryos. The single-cell transcriptomes were then ordered by the statistical method Wave-Crest to deduce both the relative position along the AP axis and the prospective lineage of single cells. The ordered transcriptomes reveal intricate patterns of gene expression along the primitive streak.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-89910/result,E-GEOD-89910,0
202,Single-cell RNA sequencing of marmoset embryonic development,"The mouse embryo is the canonical model for mammalian preimplantation development. Recent advances in single cell profiling allow detailed analysis of embryogenesis in other eutherian species, including human, to distinguish conserved from divergent regulatory programs and signalling pathways in the rodent paradigm. Here, we identify and compare transcriptional features of human, marmoset and mouse embryos by single cell RNA-seq. Zygotic genome activation correlates with the presence of polycomb repressive complexes in all three species, while ribosome biogenesis emerges as a predominant attribute in primate embryos, supporting prolonged translation of maternally deposited RNAs. We find that transposable element expression signatures are species, stage and lineage specific. The pluripotency network in the primate epiblast lacks certain regulators that are operative in mouse, but encompasses WNT components and genes associated with trophoblast specification. Sequential activation of GATA6, SOX17 and GATA4 markers of primitive endoderm identity is conserved in primates. Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and non-human primate blastocysts. Our cross-species analysis demarcates both conserved and primate-specific features of preimplantation development, and underscores the molecular adaptability of early mammalian embryogenesis.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7078/result,E-MTAB-7078,0
203,Single cell RNA-seq of a human ex vivo ovarian model with matched stromal cells,"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma is characterised by TP53 mutation and extensive chromosome instability (CIN). Because our understanding of CIN mechanisms is based largely on analysing established cell lines, we developed a workflow for generating ex vivo cultures from patient biopsies to provide models that support interrogation of CIN mechanisms in cells not extensively cultured in vitro. Here, we describe a ""living biobank"" of ovarian cancer models with extensive replicative capacity, derived from both ascites and solid biopsies. Fifteen models are characterised by p53 profiling, exome sequencing and transcriptomics, and karyotyped using single-cell whole-genome sequencing. Time-lapse microscopy reveals catastrophic and highly heterogeneous mitoses, suggesting that analysis of established cell lines probably underestimates mitotic dysfunction in advanced human cancers. Drug profiling reveals cisplatin sensitivities consistent with patient responses, demonstrating that this workflow has potential to generate personalized avatars with advantages over current pre-clinical models and the potential to guide clinical decision making.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-7249/result,E-MTAB-7249,1

Self-renewing, clonal iNBSCs can be robustly expanded in defined media while retaining multilineage differentiation potential. They generate functional cell types of neural crest and CNS lineages and could be used to model a human pain syndrome via gene editing of SCN9A in iNBSCs. NBSCs can also be derived from human pluripotent stem cells and share functional and molecular features with NBSCs isolated from embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) mouse neural folds. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified the anterior hindbrain as the origin of mouse NBSCs, with human iNBSCs sharing a similar regional identity. In summary, we identify embryonic NBSCs and report their generation by direct reprogramming in human, which may facilitate insights into neural development and provide a neural stem cell source for applications in regenerative medicine.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6912/result,E-MTAB-6912,1

206,Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung adenocarcinoma patient-derived cells,"Background:Intra-tumoral genetic and functional heterogeneity correlates with cancer clinical prognoses. However, the mechanisms by which intra-tumoral heterogeneity impacts therapeutic outcome remain poorly understood. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of single tumor cells can provide comprehensive information about gene expression and single-nucleotide variations in individual tumor cells, which may allow for the translation of heterogeneous tumor cell functional responses into customized anti-cancer treatments.Results:We isolated 34 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor cells from a lung adenocarcinoma patient tumor xenograft. Individual tumor cells were subjected to single cell RNA-seq for gene expression profiling and expressed mutation profiling. Fifty tumor-specific single-nucleotide variations, including KRAS(G12D), were observed to be heterogeneous in individual PDX cells. Semi-supervised clustering, based on KRAS(G12D) mutant expression and a risk score representing expression of 69 lung adenocarcinoma-prognostic genes, classified PDX cells into four groups. PDX cells that survived in vitro anti-cancer drug treatment displayed transcriptome signatures consistent with the group characterized by KRAS(G12D) and low risk score.Conclusions:Single-cell RNA-seq on viable PDX cells identified a candidate tumor cell subgroup associated with anti-cancer drug resistance. Thus, single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful approach for identifying unique tumor cell-specific gene expression profiles which could facilitate the development of optimized clinical anti-cancer strategies.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-CURD-11/result,E-CURD-11,1
207,Single cell RNA-seq of bone marrow biopsies of a multiple myeloma patient,"Characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity is critical to cancer therapy, as the presence of phenotypically diverse cell populations commonly fuels relapse and resistance to treatment. Although genetic variation is a well-studied source of intratumoral heterogeneity, the functional impact of most genetic alterations remains unclear. Even less understood is the relative importance of other factors influencing heterogeneity, such as epigenetic state or tumor microenvironment. To investigate the relationship between genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity in a context of cancer progression, we devised a computational approach called HoneyBADGER to identify copy number variation and loss of heterozygosity in individual cells from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. By integrating allele and normalized expression information, HoneyBADGER is able to identify and infer the presence of subclone-specific alterations in individual cells and reconstruct the underlying subclonal architecture. By examining several tumor types, we show that HoneyBADGER is effective at identifying deletions, amplifications, and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity events and is capable of robustly identifying subclonal focal alterations as small as 10 megabases. We further apply HoneyBADGER to analyze single cells from a progressive multiple myeloma patient to identify major genetic subclones that exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures relevant to cancer progression. Other prominent transcriptional subpopulations within these tumors did not line up with the genetic subclonal structure and were likely driven by alternative, nonclonal mechanisms. These results highlight the need for integrative analysis to understand the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-110499/result,E-GEOD-110499,1
208,Single-cell RNA-seq of murine medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs),"The capability of T cells for discrimination between self and non-self peptides is based on rigorous negative selection of developing thymocytes by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). The mTECs purge autoreactive T cells by expression of cell-type specific genes referred to as tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), therefore, the expression patterns of TRA genes can help understand development of mTECs and the regulatory mechanism during the development. We use single-cell RNA-sequencing to resolve patterns of TRA expression, and to elucidate how these patterns are changed during mTEC development.  Thymi were collected from 2 and 4 week-old wild-type male and female mice. The mTEC suspension obtained from sorting was loaded onto the Fluidigm C1 platform using mediumsized capture chips (10-17m cells). External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-ins (Ambion, Life Technologies) were included in the lysis buffer.

209,Single cell RNA-seq before and after salt treatment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"From bacteria to humans, individual cells within isogenic populations can show significant variation in stress tolerance, but the nature of this heterogeneity is not clear. To investigate this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-102475/result,E-GEOD-102475,0
210,Single cell RNA-seq of human LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells cultured in the absence and presence of androgen for 12 hours,"Increasing evidence suggests the presence of minor cell subpopulations in prostate cancer that are androgen independent and poised for selection as dominant clones after androgen deprivation therapy. In this study, we investigated this phenomenon by stratifying cell subpopulations based on transcriptome profiling of 144 single LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated or untreated with androgen after cell-cycle synchronization. Model-based clustering of 397 differentially expressed genes identified eight potential subpopulations of LNCaP cells, revealing a previously unappreciable level of cellular heterogeneity to androgen stimulation. One subpopulation displayed stem-like features with a slower cell doubling rate, increased sphere formation capability, and resistance to G2-M arrest induced by a mitosis inhibitor. Advanced growth of this subpopulation was associated with enhanced expression of 10 cell-cycle-related genes (CCNB2, DLGAP5, CENPF, CENPE, MKI67, PTTG1, CDC20, PLK1, HMMR, andCCNB1) and decreased dependence upon androgen receptor signaling.In silicoanalysis of RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas further demonstrated that concordant upregulation of these genes was linked to recurrent prostate cancers. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves implicates aberrant expression of these genes and could be useful for early identification of tumors that subsequently develop biochemical recurrence. Moreover, this single-cell approach provides a better understanding of how prostate cancer cells respond heterogeneously to androgen deprivation therapies and reveals characteristics of subpopulations resistant to this treatment.Significance:Illustrating the challenge in treating cancers with targeted drugs, which by selecting for drug resistance can drive metastatic progression, this study characterized the plasticity and heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells with regard to androgen dependence, defining the character or minor subpopulations of androgen-independent cells that are poised for clonal selection after androgen-deprivation therapy.Cancer Res; 78(4); 853-64.

However, the differentiation journeys toward specific hematopoietic lineages remain ill defined, and system-wide disease interpretation remains challenging. Here, we have profiled 44 802 mouse bone marrow HSPCs using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape with entry points to 8 different blood lineages (lymphoid, megakaryocyte, erythroid, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, and basophil progenitors). We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reducedMycexpression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-106973/result,E-GEOD-106973,1

We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of the total non-CM fraction and enriched (Pdgfra-GFP+) fibroblast lineage cells from murine hearts at days 3 and 7 post-sham or myocardial infarction (MI) surgery. Clustering of >30,000 single cells identified >30 populations representing nine cell lineages, including a previously undescribed fibroblast lineage trajectory present in both sham and MI hearts leading to a uniquely activated cell state defined in part by a strong anti-WNT transcriptome signature.

The number of maternally expressed genes detected in our data set is 22,687, including 8,701 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which represents a significant increase from 9,735 maternal genes detected previously by cDNA microarray. We discovered 2,733 novel lncRNAs, many of which are expressed in specific developmental stages. To address the long-standing question whether gene expression signatures of human epiblast (EPI) and in vitro hESCs are the same, we found that EPI cells and primary hESC outgrowth have dramatically different transcriptomes, with 1,498 genes showing differential expression between them.

Here we show that the amorphous neuroglia networks of the mouse ENS are composed of overlapping clonal units founded by postmigratory neural crest-derived progenitors. The spatial configuration of ENS clones depends on proliferation-driven local interactions of ENS progenitors with lineally unrelated neuroectodermal cells, the ordered colonization of the serosa-mucosa axis by clonal descendants, and gut expansion. Single-cell transcriptomics and mutagenesis analysis delineated dynamic molecular states of ENS progenitors and identified RET as a regulator of neurogenic commitment. Clonally related enteric neurons exhibit synchronous activity in response to network stimulation.

Here, we show circulating CD8+T-cell profiles from patients hospitalized with avian H7N9, seasonal IAV, and influenza vaccinees. Patient survival reflects an early, transient prevalence of highly activated CD38+HLA-DR+PD-1+CD8+T cells, whereas the prolonged persistence of this set is found in ultimately fatal cases. Single-cell T cell receptor (TCR)-Î±Î² analyses of activated CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+T cells show similar TCRÎ±Î² diversity but differential clonal expansion kinetics in surviving and fatal H7N9 patients. Delayed clonal expansion associated with an early dichotomy at a transcriptome level (as detected by single-cell RNAseq) is found in CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+T cells from patients who succumbed to the disease, suggesting a divergent differentiation pathway of CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+T cells from the outset during fatal disease. Our study proposes that effective expansion of cross-reactive influenza-specific TCRÎ±Î² clonotypes with appropriate transcriptome signatures is needed for early protection against severe influenza disease.",disease,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6379/result,E-MTAB-6379,1

Accordingly, a rational strategy minimizing survival of the drug-resistant subpopulation is essential to achieve long-term therapeutic efficacy.Results:Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the intratumoral heterogeneity of a pair of primary renal cell carcinoma and its lung metastasis. Activation of drug target pathways demonstrates considerable variability between the primary and metastatic sites, as well as among individual cancer cells within each site. Based on the prediction of multiple drug target pathway activation, we derive a combinatorial regimen co-targeting two mutually exclusive pathways for the metastatic cancer cells. This combinatorial strategy shows significant increase in the treatment efficacy over monotherapy in the experimental validation using patient-derived xenograft platforms in vitro and in vivo.Conclusions:Our findings demonstrate the investigational application of single-cell RNA-seq in the design of an anticancer regimen.

The vast repertoire and adaptive variation of BCR sequences due to V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation necessitates single-cell characterization of BCR sequences. Single-cell RNA sequencing presents the opportunity for simultaneous capture of paired BCR heavy and light chains and the transcriptomic signature.
Result: We developed VDJPuzzle, a novel bioinformatic tool that reconstructs productive, full-length B-cell receptor sequences of both heavy and light chains and extract somatic mutations on the VDJ region. VDJPuzzle successfully reconstructed BCRs from 100% (n=117) human and 96.5% (n=200) murine B cells.

To identify pathways active in mesenchyme we used tissue and single cell transcriptomics to define mesenchymal subsets and subset-specific transcript expression. We documented transcript expression using Tag-seq and RNA-seq in female rat Ventral Mesenchymal Pad (VMP) as well as adjacent urethra comprised of smooth muscle and peri-urethral mesenchyme. Transcripts enriched in female VMP were identified with Tag-seq of microdissected tissue, RNA-seq of cell populations, and single cells. We identified 400 transcripts as enriched in the VMP using bio-informatic comparisons of Tag-seq and RNA-seq data, and 44 were confirmed by single cell RNA-seq. Cell subset analysis showed that VMP and adjacent mesenchyme were composed of distinct cell types and that each tissue contained two subgroups. Markers for these subgroups were highly subset specific.

219,Determining single-cell mRNA expression profiles of a specific population isolated from zebrafish embryos at 10 hours post fertilization,"Stable zebrafish cell lines were created that expressed GFP under the control of a previously characterized mouse Smarcd3 enhancer (10.7554/eLife.03848). Specifically, the 2.7 kb Mouse Smarcd3-F6 sequence (chr5: 24113559 -24116342 from mm9 assembly) was sub-cloned from a gateway entry vector into the Zebrafish Enhancer Detection (ZED). Tol2-mediated transgenesis was performed and stable lines were created. The Smarcd3-F6:EGFPhsc70 allele was used for all genomics experiments. Smarcd3-F6:EGFPhsc70 embryos were dissociated at 10 hours post fertilization for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to collect GFP+ cells. Single-cell cDNA libraries were prepared using Fluidgim C1 system ((Fluidgim, PN 100-7168 Rev. B1)). 96 single-cell libraries were collected from three batches of experiments and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data from 92 cells (number of genes detected > 2000) were kept for clustering analysis. For the tube control experiments we performed mRNA-seq on ~4000 cells from the same embryo batches as the scRNA-seq experiments. GFP negative cells were also included to enable a GFP+ versus GFP- comparison.  Libraries were made following the Fluidgim C1 mRNA-seq tube control protocol (Fluidgim, PN 100-7168 Rev. B1). Polyadenylated mRNA was captured by Oligo-dT primers and PCR amplified after reverse transcription. Final sequencing libraries were made using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit and pair-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6077/result,E-MTAB-6077,0
220,Transcriptomic characterization of the human cell cycle in individual unsynchronized cells,"The highly fine-tuned dynamics of cell cycle gene expression have been intensely studied for several decades. However, some previous observations may be difficult to fully decouple from artifacts induced by traditional cell synchronization procedures. In addition, bulk cell measurements may have disguised intricate details. Here, we address this by sorting and transcriptomic sequencing of single cells progressing through the cell cycle without prior synchronization. Genes and pathways with known cell cycle roles are confirmed, associated regulatory sequence motifs are determined, and we also establish ties between other biological processes and the unsynchronized cell cycle. Importantly, we find the G1 phase to be surprisingly heterogeneous, with transcriptionally distinct early and late time points. We additionally note that mRNAs accumulate to reach maximum total levels at mitosis and find that stable transcripts show reduced cell-to-cell variability, consistent with the transcriptional burst model of gene expression. Our study provides the first detailed transcriptional profiling of an unsynchronized human cell cycle.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6142/result,E-MTAB-6142,1
221,Single cell RNA-sequencing of primary mouse neural plate border stem cells,"We report the direct reprogramming of both adult human fibroblasts and blood cells into induced neural plate border stem cells (iNBSCs) by ectopic expression of four neural transcription factors. Self-renewing, clonal iNBSCs can be robustly expanded in defined media while retaining multilineage differentiation potential. They generate functional cell types of neural crest and CNS lineages and could be used to model a human pain syndrome via gene editing of SCN9A in iNBSCs. NBSCs can also be derived from human pluripotent stem cells and share functional and molecular features with NBSCs isolated from embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) mouse neural folds. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified the anterior hindbrain as the origin of mouse NBSCs, with human iNBSCs sharing a similar regional identity. In summary, we identify embryonic NBSCs and report their generation by direct reprogramming in human, which may facilitate insights into neural development and provide a neural stem cell source for applications in regenerative medicine.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6925/result,E-MTAB-6925,1
222,Single-cell RNA sequencing of VE-Cadherin+ cells isolated from mouse E10.5 aorta-gonad-mesonephros region,"The endothelial to haematopoietic transition (EHT) is the process whereby haemogenic endothelium differentiates into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The intermediary steps of this process are unclear, in particular the identity of endothelial cells that give rise to HSPCs is unknown. Using single-cell transcriptome analysis and antibody screening, we identify CD44 as a marker of EHT enabling us to isolate robustly the different stages of EHT in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. This allows us to provide a detailed phenotypical and transcriptional profile of CD44-positive arterial endothelial cells from which HSPCs emerge. They are characterized with high expression of genes related to Notch signalling, TGFbeta/BMP antagonists, a downregulation of genes related to glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and a lower rate of cell cycle. Moreover, we demonstrate that by inhibiting the interaction between CD44 and its ligand hyaluronan, we can block EHT, identifying an additional regulator of HSPC development..",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6987/result,E-MTAB-6987,1
223,Single cell RNA-sequencing of Spike-ins and mESC using Smart-Seq2  on C1 System,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established and powerful method to investigate transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation, thereby revealing new cell types and providing insights into developmental processes and transcriptional stochasticity. A key question is how the variety of available protocols compare in terms of their ability to detect and accurately quantify gene expression. Here, we assessed the protocol sensitivity and accuracy of many published data sets, on the basis of spike-in standards and uniform data processing. For our workflow, we developed a flexible tool for counting the number of unique molecular identifiers (https://github.com/vals/umis/). We compared 15 protocols computationally and 4 protocols experimentally for batch-matched cell populations, in addition to investigating the effects of spike-in molecular degradation. Our analysis provides an integrated framework for comparing scRNA-seq protocols.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-5485/result,E-MTAB-5485,1
224,Single-cell RNA-seq of de-differentiated mammary adipocytes during lactation,"Adipose tissue in the mammary gland undergoes dramatic remodeling during reproduction. Adipocytes are replaced by mammary alveolar structures during pregnancy and lactation, then reappear upon weaning. The fate of the original adipocytes during lactation and the developmental origin of the re-appearing adipocyte post involution are unclear. Here, we reveal that adipocytes in the mammary gland de-differentiate into PdgfrÎ±+preadipocyte- and fibroblast-like cells during pregnancy and remain de-differentiated during lactation. Upon weaning, de-differentiated fibroblasts proliferate and re-differentiate into adipocytes. This cycle occurs over multiple pregnancies. These observations reveal the potential of terminally differentiated adipocytes to undergo repeated cycles of de-differentiation and re-differentiation in a physiological setting.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6818/result,E-MTAB-6818,1
225,Single cell RNA-seq of isolated human foetal L/M-opsin cone photoreceptor populations labelled using the AAV2/9.pR2.1.GFP reporter,"Loss of cone photoreceptors, crucial for daylight vision, has the greatest impact on sight in retinal degeneration. Transplantation of stem cell-derived L/M-opsin cones, which form 90% of the human cone population, could provide a feasible therapy to restore vision. However, transcriptomic similarities between fetal and stem cell-derived cones remain to be defined, in addition to development of cone cell purification strategies. Here, we report an analysis of the human L/M-opsin cone photoreceptor transcriptome using an AAV2/9.pR2.1:GFP reporter. This led to the identification of a cone-enriched gene signature, which we used to demonstrate similar gene expression between fetal and stem cell-derived cones. We then defined a cluster of differentiation marker combination that, when used for cell sorting, significantly enriches for cone photoreceptors from the fetal retina and stem cell-derived retinal organoids, respectively. These data may facilitate more efficient isolation of human stem cell-derived cones for use in clinical transplantation studies.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6058/result,E-MTAB-6058,1
226,Single cell RNA-seq of circulating breast cancer cells from 19 women with ER+/HER2- primary tumours,"Circulating tumour cells in women with advanced oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer acquire a HER2-positive subpopulation after multiple courses of therapy. In contrast to HER2-amplified primary breast cancer, which is highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy, the clinical significance of acquired HER2 heterogeneity during the evolution of metastatic breast cancer is unknown. Here we analyse circulating tumour cells from 19 women with ER+/HER2-primary tumours, 84% of whom had acquired circulating tumour cells expressing HER2. Cultured circulating tumour cells maintain discrete HER2+and HER2-subpopulations: HER2+circulating tumour cells are more proliferative but not addicted to HER2, consistent with activation of multiple signalling pathways; HER2-circulating tumour cells show activation of Notch and DNA damage pathways, exhibiting resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy, but sensitivity to Notch inhibition. HER2+and HER2-circulating tumour cells interconvert spontaneously, with cells of one phenotype producing daughters of the opposite within four cell doublings. Although HER2+and HER2-circulating tumour cells have comparable tumour initiating potential, differential proliferation favours the HER2+state, while oxidative stress or cytotoxic chemotherapy enhances transition to the HER2-phenotype. Simultaneous treatment with paclitaxel and Notch inhibitors achieves sustained suppression of tumorigenesis in orthotopic circulating tumour cell-derived tumour models. Together, these results point to distinct yet interconverting phenotypes within patient-derived circulating tumour cells, contributing to progression of breast cancer and acquisition of drug resistance.",cancer,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-75367/result,E-GEOD-75367,1
227,Transcriptomic profiling of antigen-specific T cells at the single-cell level after clearance of hepatitis C virus,"Heterogeneity of T cells is a hallmark of a successful adaptive immune response, harnessing the vast diversity of antigen-specific T cells into a coordinated evolution of effector and memory outcomes. The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is highly diverse to account for the highly heterogeneous antigenic world. During the response to a virus multiple individual clones of antigen specific CD8+ (Ag-specific) T cells can be identified against a single epitope and multiple epitopes are recognised. Advances in single-cell technologies have provided the potential to study Ag-specific T cell heterogeneity at both surface phenotype and transcriptome levels, thereby allowing investigation of the diversity within the same apparent sub-population. We propose a new method (VDJPuzzle) to reconstruct the native TCRÎ±Î² from single cell RNA-seq data of Ag-specific T cells and then to link these with the gene expression profile of individual cells. We applied this method using rare Ag-specific T cells isolated from peripheral blood of a subject who cleared hepatitis C virus infection. We successfully reconstructed productive TCRÎ±Î² in 56 of a total of 63 cells (89%), with double Î± and double Î² in 18, and 7% respectively, and double TCRÎ±Î² in 2 cells. The method was validated via standard single cell PCR sequencing of the TCR. We demonstrate that single-cell transcriptome analysis can successfully distinguish Ag-specific T cell populations sorted directly from resting memory cells in peripheral blood and sorted after ex vivo stimulation. This approach allows a detailed analysis of the TCR diversity and its relationship with the transcriptional profile of different clones.",immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-4850/result,E-MTAB-4850,1
228,Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals ploidy-dependent and cell-specific transcriptome changes in Arabidopsis female gametophytes,"Background:Polyploidy provides new genetic material that facilitates evolutionary novelty, species adaptation, and crop domestication. Polyploidy often leads to an increase in cell or organism size, which may affect transcript abundance or transcriptome size, but the relationship between polyploidy and transcriptome changes remains poorly understood. Plant cells often undergo endoreduplication, confounding the polyploid effect.Results:To mitigate these effects, we select female gametic cells that are developmentally stable and void of endoreduplication. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in Arabidopsis thaliana tetraploid lines and isogenic diploids, we show that transcriptome abundance doubles in the egg cell and increases approximately 1.6-fold in the central cell, consistent with cell size changes. In the central cell of tetraploid plants, DEMETER (DME) is upregulated, which can activate PRC2 family members FIS2 and MEA, and may suppress the expression of other genes. Upregulation of cell size regulators in tetraploids, including TOR and OSR2, may increase the size of reproductive cells. In diploids, the order of transcriptome abundance is central cell, synergid cell, and egg cell, consistent with their cell size variation. Remarkably, we uncover new sets of female gametophytic cell-specific transcripts with predicted biological roles; the most abundant transcripts encode families of cysteine-rich peptides, implying roles in cell-cell recognition during double fertilization.Conclusions:Transcriptome in single cells doubles in tetraploid plants compared to diploid, while the degree of change and relationship to the cell size depends on cell types. These scRNA-seq resources are free of cross-contamination and are uniquely valuable for advancing plant hybridization, reproductive biology, and polyploid genomics.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-50/result,E-ENAD-50,0

Regarding singe cell quality, genes were filtered based on a RPKM greater than or equal to 1 in at least one cell, where the RPKM cutoff was determined from histograms of number of expressed transcripts versus RPKM, and it was also sensible with respect to the number of molecules per RPKM estimated from the ERCC spike-in.

230,Single cell RNA-seq of Schistosoma mansoni stem cells from in vitro-transformed mother sporocysts,"Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms infecting hundreds of millions of people. These parasites alternate between asexual reproduction in molluscan hosts and sexual reproduction in mammalian hosts; short-lived, water-borne stages infect each host. Thriving in such disparate environments requires remarkable developmental plasticity, manifested by five body plans deployed throughout the parasite's life cycle. Stem cells inSchistosoma mansoniprovide a potential source for such plasticity; however, the relationship between stem cells from different life-cycle stages remains unclear, as does the origin of the germline, required for sexual reproduction. Here, we show that subsets of larvally derived stem cells are likely sources of adult stem cells and the germline. We also identify a novel gene that serves as the earliest marker for the schistosome germline, which emerges inside the mammalian host and is ultimately responsible for disease pathology. This work reveals the stem cell heterogeneity driving the propagation of the schistosome life cycle.",disease;immunology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-18/result,E-ENAD-18,0

Here, we combined the power of single-cell RNA sequencing, high-content imaging flow cytometry, and single-molecule RNA hybridization to analyze a subset of blood cells of the malaria mosquitoAnopheles gambiaeBy demonstrating that blood cells express nearly half of the mosquito transcriptome, our dataset represents an unprecedented view into their transcriptional program. Analyses of differentially expressed genes identified transcriptional signatures of two cell types and provide insights into the current classification of these cells. We further demonstrate the active transfer of a cellular marker between blood cells that may confound their identification. We propose that cell-to-cell exchange may contribute to cellular diversity and functional plasticity seen across biological systems.",developmental_biology,SCEA,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-19/result,E-ENAD-19,0

267,Molecular Diversity and Specializations among the Cells of the Adult Mouse Brain,"The mammalian brain is composed of diverse, specialized cell populations. To systematically ascertain and learn from these cellular specializations, we used Drop-seq to profile RNA expression in 690,000 individual cells sampled from 9 regions of the adult mouse brain. We identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells using computational approaches developed to distinguish biological from technical signals. Cross-region analysis of these 565 cell populations revealed features of brain organization, including a gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components, patterns in the co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels, functional distinctions among the cells of the vasculature and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions. Systematic neuronal classifications for two complex basal ganglia nuclei and the striatum revealed a rare population of spiny projection neurons. This adult mouse brain cell atlas, accessible through interactive online software (DropViz), serves as a reference for development, disease, and evolution.",neuroscience,Pubmed,22/08/2018,http://dropviz.org/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116470,DropViz,1
268,The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis,"Mammalian organogenesis is a remarkable process. Within a short timeframe, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most of the major internal and external organs. Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting 'mouse organogenesis cell atlas' (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle.",developmental_biology;cell_atlas,Pubmed,20/02/2019,https://oncoscape.v3.sttrcancer.org/atlas.gs.washington.edu.mouse.rna/downloads; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119945,Mouse_Atlas,1
269,Molecular Architecture of the Mouse Nervous System,"The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialized, precisely positioned, and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.",neuroscience,Pubmed,09/08/2018,http://mousebrain.org/adolescent/downloads.html; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA438862,Mouse_Nervous,1
270,Molecular architecture of the developing mouse brain,"The mammalian brain develops through a complex interplay of spatial cues generated by diffusible morphogens, cellâ€“cell interactions and intrinsic genetic programs that result in probably more than a thousand distinct cell types. A complete understanding of this process requires a systematic characterization of cell states over the entire spatiotemporal range of brain development. The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.",neuroscience,Pubmed,08/06/2020,http://mousebrain.org/development/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=PRJNA637987,Developing_mouse_brain,1
271,Spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mouse organogenesis using DNA nanoball patterned arrays,"Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are promising tools to study cell fate decisions in a physical microenvironment, which is fundamental for enhancing our knowledge of mammalian development. However, the imbalance between resolution, transcript capture and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation mammalian embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB) patterned arrays and tissue RNA capture to create SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). This approach allows transcriptomic profiling of large histological sections with high resolution and sensitivity. We have applied Stereo-seq to study the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation in a time course of mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of regional specification, neuronal migration and differentiation in the developing brain. Furthermore, we mapped the expression of a panel of developmental disease-related loci on our global transcriptomic maps to define the spatiotemporal windows of tissue vulnerability. Our panoramic atlas constitutes an essential resource to investigate longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.",developmental_biology,Pubmed,22/10/2021,https://db.cngb.org/stomics/mosta/,Mosta,1

276,Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas,"Neocortex contains a multitude of cell types segregated into layers and functionally distinct regions. To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, we analyzed 12,714 cells from the primary visual cortex (VISp), and 9,035 cells from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) by deep single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), identifying 116 transcriptomic cell types. These two regions represent distant poles of the neocortex and perform distinct functions. We define 50 inhibitory transcriptomic cell types, all of which are shared across both cortical regions. In contrast, 49 of 52 excitatory transcriptomic types were found in either VISp or ALM, with only three present in both. By combining single cell RNA-seq and retrograde labeling, we demonstrate correspondence between excitatory transcriptomic types and their region-specific long-range target specificity. This study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct regions of the mouse cortex.",neuroscience,Allen,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE115746,GSE115746,1

279,A single-cell transcriptomic map of the human and mouse pancreas reveals inter- and intra-cell population structure,"While the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures of cells. Here, we invoked inDrop, a droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq method, to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two strains of mice. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare ghrelin-expressing epsilon-cells, exocrine cell types, vascular cells, Schwann cells, quiescent and activated pancreatic stellate cells, and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles, and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta-cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER-stress. Finally, we deconvolve bulk gene expression samples using single-cell RNA-Seq to detect disease associated differential expression. Thus, our cross-species dataset provides a resource for the discovery of novel cell type-specific and cell type-restricted transcription factors, signaling receptors, and medically-relevant genes.",developmental_biology,Pubmed,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84133,GSE84133,1

We identified cell type specific genes and pathways as well as 245 genes with disturbed expression in type 2 diabetes. Importantly, 92% of the genes have not previously been associated with islet cell function or growth.

283,A single-cell transcriptome atlas of the human pancreas [CEL-seq2],"To understand organ function it is important to have an inventory of the cell types present in the tissue and of the corresponding markers that identify them. This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, since reliable markers are limited. Transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of Langerhans, which obscures contributions from rare cell types and/or potential subpopulations. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated single-cell sequencing platform to sequence the transcriptome of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We identify cell type-specific transcription factors, a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells, and cell surface markers that allow sorting of live alpha and beta cells with high purity.

Here, we directly compare seven methods for single cell and/or single nucleus profiling from three types of samples â€“ cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue â€“ generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To analyze these datasets, we developed and applied scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used for any scRNA-seq method.
