8,"Cellular heterogeneity within the mammalian brain poses a challenge towards understanding its complex functions.  Within the olfactory bulb (OB), odor information is processed by subtypes of inhibitory interneurons whose heterogeneity and functionality is influenced by ongoing adult neurogenesis.  To investigate this cellular heterogeneity, and to better understand the developmental programs of adult-born neurons, we utilized single cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling to reveal diverse and transcriptionally distinct neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We also analyzed molecular changes during adult-born interneuron maturation, and uncovered developmental programs within their gene expression profiles. Finally, we discovered that distinct neuronal subtypes are differentially affected by sensory experience. Together, these data provide a transcriptome-based foundation for investigating subtype-specific neuronal function in the OB, charting the molecular profiles that arise during the maturation and integration of adult-born neurons, and documenting activity-dependent changes in the cellular composition of the olfactory system. To develop a comprehensive profile of cellular heterogeneity within the OB, here we employed high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Zheng et al. 2017) of activity manipulated and wildtype mouse olfactory bulbs. This technique allows an in-depth categorization of single cell molecular signatures, and provides an analysis of potential developmental and activity-dependent changes that occur in adult-born neuron populations. Together, our data inform the heterogeneity of interneurons within the OB, provide a molecular blueprint of stereotyped developmental programs for OB interneurons, and reveal the transcriptional changes that govern activity-dependent circuit integration of adult-born neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms act on different subsets of adult-born neurons, driving diversity and survival of adult-born interneuron subsets in an activity-dependent manner.","Both male and female C57BL/6NJ mice at 14 weeks of age were used for analyses, maintained on a 14-h light, 10-h dark cycle, with access to food and water ad libitum. Animals were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane, and perfused intracardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were dissected, and OBs were removed from the rest of the brain. To ensure inclusion of the most anterior parts of the OB, brains were dissected out with the tissues surrounding them. Since olfactory epithelium is juxtaposed to the OB at the most anterior part of the brain, our data include some olfactory epithelium cells.OB tissue was dissociated according to the 10X Genomics Chromium sample preparation protocol.

9,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) arises through exposure to environmental carcinogens or malignant transformation by human papillomavirus (HPV). Here, we assessed the transcriptional profiles of 131,224 single cells from peripheral and intra-tumoral CD45+ immune populations from HPV– and HPV+ HNSCC and healthy donors. A spectrum of transcriptional signatures in immune lineages ranging from similar to highly divergent was present in the tumor microenvironments (TME) in HPV– and HPV+ HNSCC. CD8+ and regulatory CD4+ T cells were similar in HPV– and HPV+ HNSCC, compared to significant differences between helper CD4+ T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. Further dissection of the major immune lineages identified unique cell states and differentiation trajectories. We contextualized our results by performing multispectral immunofluorescence and evaluating putative cell-cell communication based on spatial proximity, and found longer progression free survival in patients with enrichment of a CD4+ T follicular helper cell signature. Total of 63 samples were analyzed by scRNAseq. Of these, 26 samples were paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor infiltrating immune cells from HNSCC patients (18 HPV- and 8 HPV+), 6 were peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, and 5 were tissue resident immune cells from healthy donor tonsils.",10x 3' v2 scRNAseqFicoll density gradient centrifugation to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells from whole blood; mechanical distruption of tissues; live CD45+ single cells were sorted from all samples using a Beckman Coulter MoFlo Astrios.Demultiplexing using CellRanger mkfastq Alignment and generation of gene/barcode matrices using CellRanger count Genome_build: GRCh38 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: files containing gene/barcode matrices,9
10,"Underdeveloped lungs are a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants, but our ability to help these patients by speeding up lung development are hindered by a lack of understanding of human lung developmental biology. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing of the human fetal lung from samples spanning from 11.5 weeks gestation to 21 weeks gestation from the distal lung, middle airways, and the tracheal epithelium. The primary goal of this experiment was to define fetal cell states to serve as a gold standard for pluripotent stem cell-derived lung cells and tissues, and to identify potential signaling pathways that drive differentiation of lung progenitor cells to mature cell types. Additionally, we generated bud tip progenitor organoids from 12 week human fetal lung bud tip progenitors. We show that treatment of bud tip progenitor organoids with a short pulse of dual SMAD activation (BMP4+TGFb1) led to the upregulation of lung basal cell markers, a cell type that serves as a critical stem cell for the adult airway, and that further treatment with dual SMAD inhibition leads to the generation of airway-like organoids containing differentiated cell types of the adult airway, including basal stem cells.","Immediately after tissue dissociation, single cell libraries were prepared on the 10x Chromium with a target of 10,000 cells.

We compared the cellular composition and T cell differentiation within human and mouse thymus using newly generated and repository mouse datasets. Finally, we investigated the bias in the recombination and selection of human versus mouse TCR repertoires.","All tissues were processed immediately after isolation using consistent protocols with variation in enzymatic digestion strength. Tissue was transferred to a sterile 10mm2 tissue culture dish and cut into <1mm3 segments before being transferred to a 50mL conical tube. For mild digestion, tissues were digested with 1.6mg/mL collagenase type IV (Worthington) in RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10%(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2mM L-Glutamine (Sigma- Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37°C with intermittent shaking. For stringent digestion, tissue was digested with 0.2 mg/ml Liberase ™ (Roche)/0.125 KU DNase1 (Sigma-Aldrich)/10mM HEPES in RPMI for 30 minutes at 37°C with intermittent shaking. The dissociated cells were separated and remaining undigested tissues were digested again with fresh media. This procedure was repeated until the tissue were completely dissociated. Digested tissue was passed through a 100μm filter, and cells collected by centrifugation (500g for 5 minutes at 4°C). Cells were treated with 1X red blood cell (RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 5 minutes at room temperature and washed once with flow buffer (PBS containing 5%(v/v) FBS and 2mM EDTA) prior to cell counting. Isolated thymus cells were stained with a panel of antibodies prior to sorting based on a CD45 or CD3 expression gate. The anti-human monoclonal antibodies used for flow cytometry based immunophenotyping and FAC sorting are listed in Table S1. An antibody cocktail was freshly prepared by adding 3μL of each antibody in 50μL Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD) per tissue. Cells (≤10x106) were resuspended in 50-100μL flow buffer and an equal volume of antibody mix was added to cells from each tissue. Cells were stained for 30 minutes on ice, washed with flow buffer and resuspended at 10x106 cells/mL. Immediately prior to sorting, DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 3μM and cells strained through a 35μm filter. Flow sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria™ Fusion instrument using DIVA V8, and data analysed using FlowJo V10.4.1.

14,"Clinical benefits of cytokine blockade in ileal Crohn's disease (iCD) are limited to a subset of patients. Here we applied single cell technologies to iCD lesions to address whether cellular heterogeneity contributes to treatment resistance. We found that a subset of patients expressed a unique cellular module in inflamed tissues that consisted of IgG plasma cells,  inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes  activated T cells and stromal cells which we named the GIMATS module. Analysis of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identified a distinct connectivity network that likely drives the GIMATS module. Strikingly the GIMATS module was also present in a subset of patients in 4 independent iCD cohorts (n=441)  and its presence at diagnosis correlated with failure to achieve corticosteroid-free durable remission upon anti-TNF therapy.

To generate a single cell suspension, samples were transferred to HBSS, with 5%FBS, rock inhibitor (Y-27632 10uM, Stem Cell Technologies), and 1X non-essential amino acids (11140035), disaggregated through pipetting, and filtered once in 0.25um filters and once in 0.20um strainers (Miltenyi Biotech 130-101-812). Quality control was assayed by measuring live/cell death, cell size and number of clumps. Samples with a viability above 65% were used for sequencing. 10,000 cells per sample were used for sequencing.  A suspension of 10,000 single cells was loaded onto the 10X Genomics Single Cell 3' Chip, and the dowstream cDNA synthesis was performed as per the manufacturer's protocol for the Chromium Single Cell 3' v2 Library (10X Genomics; PN-120233), to generate single cell gel beads in emulsion (GEMs).  In total, 41,025 cells were sequenced. After applying quality filters, a dataset of 38,976 cells was retained for further analysis (7476 cells from e9.5, 6769 cells from e10.5, 6634 cells from e11.5, 8711 cells from e12.5 and 9386 cells from e13.5)  Libraries were generated following manufacturer’s instructions (ChromiumTM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v2).Libraries for the samples were multiplexed so that the number of reads matched one lane per sample, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using paired-end runs. I1 fastq files contains 8 nucleotides index sequences and R1/R2 files contains 101 bp sequences. R1 sequences start with a 16bp cell barcode, followed by a 10bp UMI barcode and the R2 cDNA read with the poly-T region of the barcoded gel bead primer. The 12 libraries were sequenced once, each one during a single sequencing run. The sequencing was performed on either 1 lane (Sample 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10), 2 lanes (Sample 4, 8) or 4 lanes (Sample 9, 11 ,12). Barcode and UMI counting was performed using 10X Genomics Cell Ranger under default settings. The aggregated gene-barcode matrix was normalized by subsampling reads from higher-depth libraries until all samples had an equal number of confidently mapped reads per cell.",15

17,"There is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 which has infected more than 3 million people worldwide. Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease and 5% require intensive care. Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes, lymphopenia, and T cell exhaustion. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 7 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and 6 healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature, HLA class II downregulation, and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, we provide a cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to severe COVID-19.  Sample IDs used in the manuscript were shortened for clarity. They relate to the titles of deposited files as follows:  covid_555_1: C1 A covid_555_2: C1 B covid_556: C2 covid_557: C3 covid_558: C4 covid_559: C5 covid_561: C7 HIP002: H1 HIP015: H2 HIP023: H3 HIP043: H4 HIP044: H5 HIP045: H6 Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 8 samples from COVID-19 patients and 6 healthy controls.","No growth or treatment performedNo growth or treatment performedImmediately after Ficoll separation, 50,000 PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI + 10% FCS at a concentration of 75,000 cells/mL. 200 μL of this cell suspension (15,000 cells) was then loaded onto Seq-Well arrays pre-loaded with mRNA capture beads (ChemGenes). Following four washes with DPBS to remove serum, the arrays were sealed with a polycarbonate membrane (pore size of 0.01 µm) for 30 minutes at 37°C and then frozen at -80°C for no less than 24 hours and no more than 14 days to allow batching of samples processed at irregular hours. Next, arrays were thawed, cells lysed, transcripts hybridized to the mRNA capture beads, and beads recovered from the arrays and pooled for downstream processing. Library preparation was performed with a Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina FC-131-1096) with 1 ng of pooled library using dual-index primers. Tagmented and amplified libraries were again purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads with a 0.6x volume wash followed by a 1.0x volume wash, and quality and concentration determined by Fragment Analysis. Libraries between 400-1000bp with no primer peaks were considered successful and pooled for sequencing. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq S2 instrument (Illumina; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub). The read structure was paired-end with read 1 beginning from a custom read 1 primer11 containing a 12bp cell barcode and an 8 bp unique molecular identifier (UMI), and with read 2 containing 50bp of mRNA sequence.Illumina NovaSeq 6000",17
18,"Spermatogenesis is a recurring differentiation process that results in the production of male gametes within the testes. During this process, spermatogonial stem cells differentiate to form spermatocytes, which undergo two rounds of meiotic division to form haploid spermatids. Throughout spermiogenesis, round spermatids elongate to form mature sperm. To profile maturing germ cells during the first wave of spermatogenesis, we generated droplet-based single cell RNAseq from juvenile animals at post-natal day P5-P35 as well as adult animals. Cells were isolated from whole testes. Furthermore, to assay the robustness of the meiotic cell division process, we profiled germ cells of the trans-chromosomal mouse model (Tc1) that carries a copy of the human chromosome 21.","To generate a genomic reference for sequence alignment, the full mus musculus genome (GRCm38) was concatenated with the sequence of the human chromosome 21 (taken from GRCh38). Similarly, the genomic annotation for mus musculus (GRCm38.88) was merged with the annotation for human chromosome 21 (taken from GRCh38.88). The Cell Ranger v1.3.1 mkref function with default settings was used to process the genomic sequence and the annotation file for read alignment. To obtain gene-specific transcript counts, the Cell Ranger v1.3.1 count function with default settings was used to align and count unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per sample. The raw UMI counts of CellRanger filtered cells after quality control can be found in: raw_counts.mtx. Furthermore, the emptyDrops function form the Bioconductor package DropletUtils was used to capture cells with lower transcriptional complexity.

20,"Human T cells coordinate adaptive immunity in diverse anatomic compartments through production of cytokines and effector molecules, but it is unclear how tissue site influences T cell persistence and function. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of >50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease.","Lungs were flushed with cold complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine) and left lateral basal segment of the lung was isolated.Bone Marrow was aspirated from the superior iliac crest.Lymph nodes were isolated from the hilum, near the intersections of major bronchi and pulmonary veins and arteries, removing all fat.We obtained peripheral blood from healthy consenting adult volunteers by venipuncture, through a protocol approved by the Columbia University IRB.

21,"Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience mild COVID-19, some patients suffer from severe COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation. To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly upregulation of the TNF/IL-1-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response co-existed with the TNF/IL-1-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19 infection. Based on this, we propose that the type I IFN response exacerbates inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing performed with PBMC of 5 flu, 11 COVID-19 patients and 4 healthy controls.","The library was constructed using the Chromium Single Cell 3' Library & Gel Bead Kit v3.

22,"Heterogeneity of lung tumor endothelial cell (TEC) phenotypes across patients, species (human/mouse) and models (in vivo/vitro) remains poorly inventoried at the single-cell-level. We single-cell RNA-sequenced 56,771 ECs from human/mouse (peri)-tumoral lung and cultured human lung TECs, detected 17 known and discovered 16 novel phenotypes, including TECs presumably regulating immune surveillance. We resolved the canonical tip TECs into a known migratory tip and a novel basement-membrane remodeling breach phenotype. Tip-TEC signatures correlated with patient-survival, and tip/breach TECs were most sensitive to VEGF-blockade. By similarity analysis, only tip-TECs were congruent across species/models and shared conserved markers. Integrated analysis of the scRNA-seq data with orthogonal multi-omics and meta-analysis data across different human tumors, validated by functional analysis, identified collagen-modification as angiogenic candidate pathway.","Freshly-dissected tissue was placed into a C-tube (Miltenyi Biotec) containing 5 ml digestion buffer (0.1% collagenase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.25% collagenase type 4 (Worthington Biochemical), DNase I (150 U/min) in DMEM supplemented with 1x sodium pyruvate, 1x MEM NEAAs, ECGF/Heparin, antibiotic/antimycotic (2x) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific)) and processed with the m_lung_01 program of gentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec).

24,"The outcome of cardiac repair post myocardial infarction is highly dependent on the balance between inflammation and fibrosis, which can lead to adverse ventricular remodeling and failure or early cardiac rupture. In order to profile the dynamic response of the interstitium to cardiac ischemic injury, we performed unbiased single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNAseq) on cardiac interstitial cells at homeostasis and 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 28 days post-injury using transgenic mice on C57bl/6j background (B6), expressing ZsGreen under the control of the epicardial marker Wt1 (Wt1Cre;RosaZsgreenf/+). About 38,600 cells were captured using the 10xChromium technology. To gain insights on how cell composition and transcriptome can affect the predisposition to cardiac rupture, we compared the data on B6 background with 129S1/SvlmJ (129) mice sham and d3 post-MI (time point proceeding the rupture), capturing about 13,000 additional cells.","Adult murine hearts(ventricles) were collected at homeostasis or different time points post_MI.Heart ventricles were dissected, mechanically cut into small pieces with a scalpel and subjected to two 15min digestions with 263U/ml collagenase type II (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, LS004177), under magnetic agitation at 250rpm at 37C. Cell suspensions were passed through a 40 μm cell strainer to remove cardiomyocytes, small fragment of undigested tissue and collected on ice in a conical 50ml tube containing with 2%FCS (VWR Seradigm, 97068-085). Cells were spun at 300g for 5 min and pre-warmed red cell lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, R7757) was added for 1 min to remove blood cells. After washing, cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of Dead Cell Removal MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-090-101) and incubated 10 min at room temperature in the dark.

25,"The shoot apical meristem allows for reiterative formation of new aerial structures throughout the life cycle of a plant. We use single-cell RNA sequencing to define the cellular taxonomy of the Arabidopsis vegetative shoot apex at the transcriptome level. We find that the shoot apex is composed of highly heterogeneous cells, which can be partitioned into 7 broad populations with 23 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. We delineate cell-cycle continuums and developmental trajectories of epidermal cells, vascular tissue, and leaf mesophyll cells and infer transcription factors and gene expression signatures associated with cell fate decisions. Integrative analysis of shoot and root apical cell populations further reveals common and distinct features of epidermal and vascular tissues. Our results, thus, offer a valuable resource for investigating the basic principles underlying cell division and differentiation in plants at single-cell resolution.","The wild-type A. thaliana (Col-0 ecotype) were used for all the experiments. Plants were grown on soil at 21°C (day)/19°C (night) in long days (16 h light/8 h dark, with a light intensity of 80 mmol/m2/s using Philips TLD 36W/865 and 36W/830 bulbs).According to 10x Genomics User Guide, there are strict requirements on protoplast purity and concentration. Based on the results of our pilot experiments, we found that ∼500 vegetative shoot apices can yield enough high quality protoplasts. The single cells were prepared as previously described with modifications (Zhang et al., 2019). Briefly, we harvested the shoot apices from 7-day-old seedlings (shoot #1) and 14-day-old plants (shoot #2), and the 3rd leaf (leaf) from 18-day-old plants, respectively (Figures S1A–S1C). The tissues were separately digested in the RNase-free enzyme solution (1.5% cellulase R10, 1.5% macerozyme R10, 0.4 M mannitol, 0.1 M 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA) for 2 h at room temperature (Figure S1D). To increase enzymatic digestion efficiency and enhance protoplast release, we gently dissected shoot apices using syringe needle during protoplasting. The protoplasts were filtered 3-4 times with cell strainers (40 μm in diameter, Falcon, Cat No./ID: 352340), concentrated and washed 3-4 times with 8% mannitol at room temperature. The protoplast viability was determined by trypan blue staining. The ratio of viable cells to total cells of each sample was higher than 85%. The protoplast suspension was counted by a hemocytometer. The concentration of protoplasts was finally adjusted to 1,500 ∼ 2,000 cells/μL.scRNA-seq libraries were prepared as previously described (Zhang et al., 2019). Briefly, the shoot apices or leaf cell suspensions were loaded on a Chromium Single Cell Instrument (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) to generate single cell GEMs. scRNA-seq libraries were generated with the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Gel Bead and Library Kit v3 (P/N 1000075, 1000073, 10x Genomics).

26,"There is pressing urgency to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes the disease COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein binds ACE2, and in concert with host proteases, principally TMPRSS2, promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues, and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression, remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 amongst tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discover that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells, and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection. Samples from 8 datasets are included: single-cell RNA-Seq studies: 2 human adult donors of inferior turbinate scrapings with two replicates each.

In this study, mice were 8-10 weeks of age, representing male and female animals. Mice received either 200ng of IFNα (Biolegend 752802) or saline intranasally (each group n = 2 mice), and were sacrificed 12 h later. Respiratory and olfactory mucosa were isolated as in (Davidson et al., 2004, Dunston et al., 2013). Briefly, using surgical tools under a dissecting microscope, the skull bones surrounding the nasal tissue of skinned mouse heads were removed. The respiratory and olfactory mucosa were collected in RPMI media with 10% FBS. Cells were digested in media containing Liberase TM (Roche) and DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37°C with agitation. Cells were filtered using a 70 μm strainer, washed with EDTA-containing media to quench enzymatic digestion, and pelleted by centrifugation. RBCs were lysed using ACK buffer (ThermoFisher) for 2 min, cells were again pelleted, counted, and prepared as a diluted single cell suspension for scRNA-seq using Seq-Well S3.Libraries corresponding to 4 mice, with 2 Seq-Well arrays per mouse were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq as described (Gierahn et al., 2017, Hughes et al., 2019).Single-cell RNA capture, barcoding, and multiplexing according to the Seq-Well S^3 method (Hughes et al., BioRxiv 2019)Reads aligned and pre-processed according to the DropSeq Computational Protocol v2.0 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq) mm10 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed data is a tab or comma delimited text file containing a digital gene expression matrix with the number of UMIs for each gene (rows) and cell barcode (columns)",26

28,"Chimeric embryos were generated to investigate the effect of Tal1 knockout in mouse embryos by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Tal1 is an essential transcription factor for the formation of the embryonic blood. Embryo chimerism permits the analysis of the effects of Tal1 knockout without the confounding effects of the absence of embryonic blood, which results in global developmental failures. Embryos were generated by blastocyst injection of tdTomato-labelled, Tal1-/- mouse embryonic stem cells into wild type embryos. After blastocyst harvest, cells were flow-sorted before 10X Genomics library preparation and single-cell RNA-sequencing.","Steps were performed according to manufacturers' instructions (10X Genomics, v2 chemistry).TdTomato-expressing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) were derived as previously described(http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/pdb.prot094086) from E3.5 blastocysts obtained by crossing a male ROSA26tdTomato (Jax Labs – 007905) with a wildtype C57BL/6 female. The cells were expanded under the 2i+LIF conditions(https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature06968) and transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing Cre using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific # L3000008) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Single GFP+ cells were sorted 48h post-transfection into 96-well plates. Individual clones were allowed to grow and were manually picked for expansion. A tdTomato+, male, karyotypically normal line, competent for chimera generation as assessed using morula aggregation assay, was selected for targeting Tal1. Two guides targeting exon 4 were designed using the http://crispr.mit.edu tool (guide 1: GAACCCACTATGGAAAGAGA; guide 2: GAGGCCCTCCCCATATGAGA) and were cloned into the pX458 plasmid (Addgene, #48138) as previously described https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2013.143. The resulting plasmids were then used to transfect the cells as detailed above. Single transfected clones were expanded and assessed for Cas9-induced mutations. An ESC clone showing a 77 base-pair deletion in exon 4 inactivating Tal1 gene expression was then injected into C57BL/6 E3.5 blastocysts. Chimeric embryos were subsequently transferred into recipient females at 0.5 days of pseudopregnancy following mating with vasectomised males, as described previously(https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.096875).

Samples were rinsed with PBS, and each sample was subsequently minced into smaller pieces of less than 1 mm3 on ice, and transferred to 10 mL digestion medium (DMEM [Gibco] with 2mg/ml of Collagenase P [Roche] and 0.2mg/ml of DNAse I [Roche]).  Samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C, with manual shaking every 5 minutes. Samples were then vortexed for 10 seconds, and pipetted up and down for 1 minute using pipettes of descending sizes (25 mL, 10 mL and 5 mL). Next, 30 mL ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS [ThermoFisher Scientific]) was added, samples were filtered using a 40µm nylon mesh (ThermoFisher Scientific). Following centrifugation at 300 G at 4°C for 5 minutes, the supernatant was decanted and discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma) and transferred to a 2 mL DNA low bind tube. Following a 5-minute incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged (150 G, 4°C, 5 min) using a swing-out rotor. Samples were next resuspended in 1 mL PBS containing 8 µL UltraPure bovine serum albumin (50 mg/mL, AM2616 [ThermoFisher Scientific]) and filtered over Scienceware Flowmi 40 µm cell strainers (VWR) using wide bore 1 mL low retention filter tips (Mettler-Toledo).  10 µL (9 µL of cell suspension plus 1 µL AOPI) of this cell suspension was next counted using an automated cell counter (Luna) to determine the concentration of live cells.Single cell suspensions were converted to barcoded 10x libraries by using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library, Gel Bead & Multiplex Kit and Chip Kit (10X Genomics; Pleasanton, California, USA), aiming for an estimated 7,000 cells per library.Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq, HiSeq4000 and NovaSeq until read saturation is reached.

Our scSeq analysis defines the adaptive immune repertoire and transcriptome in convalescent COVID-19 patients and shows important age-related differences implicated in immunity against SARS-CoV-2.,"PBMC samples were thawed, washed in complete media (RPMI 1640, 10%(v/v) FBS) and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL complete media, counted and treated with 10 U ml−1 DNAse I (Stemcell Technologies, #) for 15 min at RT in order to prevent cell clumping. After DNase I digestion, cells were washed twice in complete media, pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 mL flow cytometry buffer (PBS, 2%(v/v) FBS, 2 mM EDTA). The cell suspension was filtered through a 40 μM cell strainer prior to immunomagnetic isolation. As a first step, plasma cells were isolated using the EasySep Human CD138 Positive Selection Kit II (Stemcell Technologies, #17877) for analysis in a companion study (manuscript in preparation). The negative fraction of the above selections was divided into two aliquots that were subjected to negative immunomagnetic isolation of either B cells (EasySep Human Pan-B cell Enrichment Kit, Stemcell Technologies, #19554) or T cells (EasySep Human T cell Isolation Kit, Stemcell Technologies, #17951). After isolation, B cells and T cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, 0.4%(v/v) BSA, filtered through a 40 μM cell strainer and counted. T cells and B cells originating from the same patient were pooled in equal numbers and the final suspension was counted and assessed for viability using a fluorescent cell counter (Cellometer Spectrum, Nexcelom). Whenever possible, cells were adjusted to a concentration of 1×106 live cells/mL in PBS, 0.04%(v/v) BSA before proceeding with droplet generation.Encapsulation of lymphocytes and DNA-barcoded gel beads was performed using the Chromium controller (10x Genomics, PN-110203). Briefly, 1.4×104 to 1.7×104 cells (in reverse transcription mix) were loaded per channel for a targeted recovery of 8×103 to 1×104 cells per sample. Reverse transcription and preparation of single-cell transcriptome, BCR and TCR libraries was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CG000086 manual, RevM, 10x Genomics) and using the following kits: Chromium Single Cell 5’ Library & Gel Bead Kit (PN-1000006), Chromium Single Cell 5’ Library Construction Kit (PN-1000020), Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell (PN-1000005), Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human B Cell (PN-1000016), Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit (PN-1000009), Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (PN-120262).The quality and concentrations of transcriptome (i.e., cDNA), TCR and BCR libraries were determined using a fragment analyzer (Agilent Bioanalyzer) at specific steps of library preparation, as recommended in the 10x Genomics scSeq protocol (CG000086 manual, RevM). Following multiplexing (Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit, #PN-120262, 10x Genomics), transcriptome libraries were treated with free adapter blocking (FAB) reagent to prevent index switching (#20024144, Illlumina). Paired-end sequencing of multiplexed transcriptome libraries was performed using a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) and SP100-cycle kit (#20027464, Illumina).

32,"Crop productivity depends on activity of meristems that produce optimized plant architectures, including that of the maize ear. A comprehensive understanding of development requires insight into the full diversity of cell types and developmental domains and the gene networks required to specify them. Until now, these were identified primarily by morphology and insights from classical genetics, which are limited by genetic redundancy and pleiotropy. Here, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of 12,525 single cells from developing maize ears. The resulting developmental atlas provides a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) map of an inflorescence. We validated our results by mRNA in situ hybridization and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) RNA-seq, and we show how these data may facilitate genetic studies by predicting genetic redundancy, integrating transcriptional networks, and identifying candidate genes associated with crop yield traits.","scRNA-seq libraries were sequenced by Illumina short reads with ∼400M paired end reads per library (read1 = 28bp, read2 = 56bp) (Table S1). Raw sequencing data were deposited in NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA). SRA IDs were listed in Table S1.For the three biological replicates of wild type (B73) whole ear samples, protoplasts were prepared as previously described but without L-cysteine pretreatment (Ortiz-Ramírez et al., 2018). 5-10mm developing ears were dissected into protoplast washing buffer and diced with a razor blade to 0.5-1mm pieces, then washed three times with protoplast washing buffer before adding enzyme solution. Tissues were protoplasted for ∼45min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The mixture was filtered through a 30μm cell strainer (pluriStrainer, 43-50030-50) then collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 3 min at 4°C. The supernatant was gently removed without disturbing the protoplast pellet, which was washed by gentle resuspension in protoplast washing buffer. Protoplasts were then filtered as before and purified by FACS sorting (FACSAria II SORP with 100-micron setup, purity precision, yield mask at 32, purity mask at 32, plates voltage at 2,500, voltage centering at 20, sheath pressure at 20, and target gap at 12). Protoplasts were sorted into 1 × PBS with 0.1% BSA and 0.4M mannitol, and pelleted at 400 g for 2 min at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully removed, leaving 20-40μl to gently resuspend the pellet. The protoplasts were stained with trypan blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15250061) to check concentration and viability with a hemocytometer under a light microscope, and good quality protoplasts with viability ≥ 70% were immediately loaded into the 10x Genomics Chromium System using V2 chemistry kits.All analyses were performed with Zea mays (Maize) collected in 2018. Maize plants were grown in the summer field (June – October) of Uplands Farm Agricultural Station at Cold Spring Harbor, New York or in the greenhouse with 16 h daytime, 26-28°C, and 8 h night, 22-24°C (Wu et al., 2020). Reference B73 inbred plants were used for single-cell experiments. The pZmYAB14-TagRFPt reporter line (Je et al., 2016) and ZmM16-YFP translational fusion line (Bartlett et al., 2015) were obtained from previous studies. The ZmHDZIV6-YFP translational fusion line was constructed using ZmHDZIV6 native promoter and coding sequence as previously described in the pTF101 Gateway-compatible vector (Je et al., 2016), primer sequences were listed in Table S4. The pZmYAB14-TagRFPt reporter line and ZmHDZIV6-YFP translational fusion line were introgressed into a proliferative cauliflower-like double mutant line, bd1;Tu, to generate a large amount of ear meristem tissue for FACS RNA-seq and ChIP-seq respectively. Primer sequences for genotyping bd1 are listed in Table S4. Tu genotyping was performed as previously described (Han et al., 2012).",32
33,"We have created a compendium of single cell transcriptome data from the model organism Mus musculus comprising more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, revealing gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and allowing for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from distinct anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most tissues: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3’-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis, enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology. NOTE: This dataset represents a subset of the original GSE109774 containing only 57,760 cells sequenced using FACS-based full-length single cell RNA-seq.","Four 10-15 week old male and four virgin female C57BL/6 mice were shipped from the National Institute on Aging colony at Charles River to the Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) at the VA Palo Alto (VA). At both locations, mice were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and provided food and water ad libitum. Prior to tissue collection, mice were placed in sterile collection chambers for 15 minutes to collect fresh fecal pellets. Following anesthetization with 2.5% v/v Avertin, mice were weighed, shaved, and blood drawn via cardiac puncture before transcardial perfusion with 20 ml PBS. Mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) was then immediately collected to avoid exposure to the liver and pancreas perfusate, which negatively impacts cell sorting. Isolating viable single cells from both pancreas and liver of the same mouse was not possible, therefore, 2 males and 2 females were used for each. Whole organs were then dissected in the following order: large intestine, spleen, thymus, trachea, tongue, brain, heart, lung, kidney, gonadal adipose tissue (GAT), bladder, diaphragm, limb muscle (tibialis anterior), skin (dorsal), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT, inguinal pad), mammary glands (fat pads 2, 3, and 4), brown adipose tissue (BAT, interscapular pad), aorta, and bone marrow (spine and limb bones).Lysis plates were created by dispensing 0.4 ul lysis buffer (0.5 U Recombinant RNase Inhibitor (Takara Bio, 2313B), 0.0625% Triton X-100 (Sigma, 93443-100ML), 3.125 mM dNTP mix (Thermo Fisher, R0193), 3.125 uM Oligo-dT30 VN (IDT, 5'AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACT30VN-3') and 1:600000 ERCC RNA spike-in mix (Thermo Fisher, 4456740)) into 384-well hard-shell PCR plates (Biorad HSP3901) using a Tempest liquid handler (Formulatrix). 96-well lysis plates were also prepared with 4 ul lysis buffer. All plates were sealed with AlumaSeal CS Films (Sigma-Aldrich Z722634) and spun down (3,220 x g, 1 minute) and snap frozen on dry ice. Plates were stored at -80°C until sorting. After dissociation, single cells from each organ and tissue were isolated into 384- or 96-well plates via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Single-cell sorting in 96-well plates followed by cDNA preparation using Smart-seq2 followed by library preparation using Nextera XT Nextera tagmentation according to the standard protocol for single cell RNA-seq following Smart-Seq2Libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina) using 2 x 100bp paired-end reads",33
34,"Spermatogenesis has been well studied in rodents and invertebrates, but remains poorly understood in humans. As a step towards illuminating human spermatogenesis, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis to analyze neonatal and adult human testes. Clustering analysis of neonatal testes revealed 3 germ subsets, including cells with characteristics of primordial germ cells (PGCs), and more differentiated cells with gene expression profiles similar with adult spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). We identified markers for these neonatal subsets, including protein markers for the PGC-like (PGCL) subset. Clustering analysis of the adult testis revealed 9 germ and 3 somatic cell subsets. Among the germ cell clusters are 4 undifferentiated spermatogonia (SPG) states, each marked by specific genes. One of the SPG states has characteristics suggesting it is enriched for SSCs. We identified protein markers specific for this state, including cell-surface proteins that we used to enrich for these cells. We mapped the timeline of male germ cell development from PGCs through fetal germ cells to differentiating adult SPG stages. We also defined somatic cell subsets in the human testis and traced their developmental trajectories.  Together, our data provides a blueprint for understanding the development of the male germline and supporting somatic cells in humans. The germ cell subset markers we identified are candidates to be used for clinical applications, including SSC therapy for treating infertility.  Single cell sequencing from two neonatal and two adult testicular cells was performed.

Informed consent was obtained from all the human subjects.  Testicular biopsies were obtained from two fertile men aged 37- and 42-years, undergoing vasectomy reversal at the UCSD Medical Center, following IRB-approved protocol #120471. The biopsies were transported to the research laboratory on ice in Minimum Essential Medium Alpha Medium (αMEM) + 10% FBS. The samples were then immediately cut into smaller portions and cryopreserved using freezing media composed of 10% DMSO + 90% FBS under controlled cooling conditions in a freezing container (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat # 5100-0001) at −80°C. The samples were subsequently transferred to liquid nitrogen storage until use. The neonatal testes we used for our scRNaseq analysis were obtained from the University of Michigan Medical Center, following IRB-approved protocol HUM00097035. These testes were from unrelated day 2 and day 7 neonates who died as a result of non-testicular-related medical dysfunction; they were cryopreserved in vials in liquid nitrogen and later transported to UCSD on dry ice.Single testicular cells were isolated using a two-step enzymatic digestion protocol described previously (Valli et al., 2014b). In brief, testicular tissue was mechanically disrupted and enzymatically digested with 1 mg ml-1 collagenase type IV (Worthington Biochemical) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; GIBCO) at 37°C. The tubules were sedimented and washed with HBSS and digested in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (ThermoFisher) and Deoxyribonuclease I (Worthington Biochemical). The suspension was triturated vigorously ten times, incubated at 37°C for 5 min, followed by repeat trituration and incubation. The digestion was stopped by adding the same volume of αMEM + 10% FBS medium and the cells were size-filtered through 70 μm (ThermoFisher) and 40 μm strainers (ThermoFisher) and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Integrin-α6 (ITGA6)+ cells were purified from the isolated testicular cell preparations described above using the MACS system. The cells were re-suspended in MACS buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 2mM EDTA) + Deoxyribonuclease I, incubated with ITGA6 antibody (BD PharMingen; 1:50) for 20 mins on ice, washed with MACS buffer, incubated with anti-rat IgG microbeads for 20 mins on ice, washed in MACS buffer, re-suspended in 500μl MACS buffer, and run through a MACS MS column (Miltenyi Biotec, cat # 130-042-201). The cells were then eluted with MACS buffer and resuspended in PBS + 0.25% FBS. The dead cells were removed using the ClioCell Dead Cell Removal kit (Amsbio) following the manufacturers’ instructions. The samples from the 4 testes biopsies (neonatal + adult) were processed in exactly the same manner to minimize technical bias.Viable cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 0.04% BSA in PBS for loading on the 10x Chromium chip. Cell capturing, and library preparation was carried as per kit instructions (Chromium Single Cell Kit [v2 chemistry]).

The dish was rotated at 85 rpm for 1 h at 25°C, and then the cell solution was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in 500 μL washing solution (0.4 M Mannitol, 20 mM MES [pH 5.7], 20 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.1% [w/v] bovine serum albumin). The protoplast solution was strained through a 70-μm filter, and then twice through a 40-μm filter. The filtered solution was centrifuged at 200 g for 6 min, and the pelleted protoplasts resuspended with 30–50 μL washing solution to achieve the desired cell concentration (∼104 protoplasts/mL). The protoplast suspension was loaded into Chromium microfluidic chips with 30 v2 chemistry and barcoded with a 10× Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). RNA from the barcoded cells was subsequently reverse-transcribed and sequencing libraries constructed with reagents from a Chromium Single Cell 30 v2 reagent kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed with Illumina HiSeq 4000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina).After isolating protoplasts from roots, load into 10X Genomics unit for single-cell cDNA library construction.

36,"The Drosophila lymph gland (LG) is the larval hematopoietic organ comprised of multipotent prohemocytes and mature hemocytes and has been a valuable model for understanding mechanisms underlying the hematopoiesis and immune responses. There are three types of mature hemocytes in the lymph gland; plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells, all of which are analogous to myeloid-lineage blood cells. To date, the Drosophila hematopoietic system has been primarily defined by classical genetic methods that may limit the promise of its advantage as a model. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing method to comprehensively profile the heterogeneity of developing myeloid hemocytes in the wild-type lymph gland and their transitions upon active immunity caused by wasp infestation. Moreover, we compared hemocytes originated from the embryonic and the lymph gland hematopoiesis and unraveled genetic and cellular diversity of two different ancestries. Finally, hemocytes of the Drosophila lymph gland and human immune cells are contrasted at a transcriptome level, highlighting evolutionary conservations of myeloid cells across species. Overall, our single-cell RNA seq analyses disclose the development of myeloid hemocytes at a single-cell level and provide comparative insights into two different lineages of hemocytes in Drosophila and perspectives on the evolution of myeloid cells, serving as an ample resource for revealing essentials of the hematopoiesis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of Drosophila larvae LGs or circulating hemocytes under normal or wasp infested states using Drop-seq","Raw paired-end fastq files were merged into a single bam file using picard FastqToSam An unaligned bam file was then preprocessed and aligned to fly reference genome using Drop-seq_alignment.sh pipeline in the Drop-seq alignment toolkit. The aligner used in this pipeline was STAR (2.5.3a). Aligned reads were quantified using BAMTagHistogram provided in the Dorp-seq alignment toolkit. A cutoff value for proper cell number was determined by calculating cumulative read fractions. UMI count matrix was generated using DigitalExpression provided in the Drop-seq alignment toolkit with aligned read count cutoff determined in the previous step.

Hatched larvae were discarded at 23 hours after egg laying (AEL), and those at 24 hours AEL were collected and reared on normal corn-meal yeast media.100 to 150 primary LGs were dissected and kept in 200 µl ice-cooled Schneider’s medium (Gibco, 21720024). After dissection, centrifugation at 3,000 rpm and 4 ℃ for 5 minutes was done. Supernatant was discarded and 300 µl of room-temperature Schneider’s medium was added to the lymph gland primary lobes. 300 µl of Papain (Worthington, LK003178) pre-heated to 37 ℃, and 4.1 µl of Liberase TM (Roche, 5401119001) were added and gently mixed. The samples were incubated for 20 minutes with gentle nutation. At 5-, 10-, and 15-minute time points of incubation, samples were mixed using 200p pipette. Enzymes were inactivated with 100 µl of ice-cooled Schneider’s medium, and samples were kept on ice. Suspended cells were passed through a 40 µm cell strainer (Corning, 352340). After, centrifugation at 3,000 rpm and 4 ℃ for 5 minutes was done. Supernatant was discarded, and 1X filtered sterile PBS was added to cells. Final concentration of cells was fixed to 300 cells/µl for a total of 600 µl. All the Drop-seq and cDNA synthesis methods were followed by previous study (Macosko, Evan Z., et al. &quot;Highly parallel genome-wide expression profiling of individual cells using nanoliter droplets.&quot; Cell 161.5 (2015): 1202-1214.). The concentration of beads was fixed to 300 beads/u. Around 10 minutes Drop-seq run performed for each experiment. single-cell RNA-seq (Drop-seq)",36
37,"The regulation of stomatal lineage cell development has been extensively investigated. However, a comprehensive characterization of this biological process based on single-cell transcriptome analysis has not yet been reported. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing on 12 844 individual cells from the cotyledons of 5-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings. We identified 11 cell clusters corresponding mostly to cells at specific stomatal developmental stages using a series of marker genes. Comparative analysis of genes with the highest variable expression among these cell clusters revealed transcriptional networks that regulate development from meristemoid mother cells to guard mother cells. Examination of the developmental dynamics of marker genes via pseudo-time analysis revealed potential interactions between these genes. Collectively, our study opens the door for understanding how the identified novel marker genes participate in the regulation of stomatal lineage cell development.","Cotyledons of 5-day-old seedlings were harvested for extracting total RNA using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. The samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 7 were subjected to subsequent RNA-seq analysis.  Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeq 2500 or Illumina HiSeq X Ten) and 125-bp/150-bp paired-end reads were generated.We prepared scRNA-seq libraries with the Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ Gel Beads-in-Emulsion Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 according to the user manual supplied by the kit.Arabidopsis plants grown on either Metro-Mix 360 or Jiffy7 soil in a greenhouse or an environment-controlled chamber with a relatively short photoperiod (10–13 h light at 23 °C/11–14 h dark at 20 °C) under low light (50–75 μE m−2 s−1) and 40–65% relative humidity. We isolated protoplasts from cotyledons of 5-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings as described previously (Yoo et al., 2007) with slight modifications to adjust for the use cotyledon tissue. In brief, the cotyledons were harvested from seedlings and submerged in a solution (0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MES [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid], 1.5% Cellulase RS, 0.03% Pectolyase Y23, 0.25% BSA, 33 mg/l actinomycin D, and 100 mg/l cordycepin [pH 5.5]) under vacuum for 10 min. The samples were then incubated for 4 h to isolate protoplasts. Thereafter, the isolated cells were washed three times with 8% mannitol buffer to remove Mg2+. Cells were then filtered with a 40-μm cell strainer. Cell activity was detected by trypan blue staining, and cell concentration was measured with a hemocytometer.",37
38,"A subset of COVID-19 patients exhibit altered olfactory function. Here we analyze bulk and single cell RNA-Seq datasets to identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express cell entry molecules that mediate infection by SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the causal agent in COVID-19. We find that samples from whole olfactory mucosa in species including mouse and human express two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry,  ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, neither olfactory sensory neurons nor olfactory bulb neurons express these genes, which are instead expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients. Eight 15 min Drop-seq runs from dissociated whole olfactory mucosa from five adult male C57BL/6 mice (8-12 weeks-old). Additional Drop-Seq data from the olfactory bulb can be found in GSE148360.","Drop-seq experiments (cell capture, reverse transcription, PCR, tagmentation), were performed as described in Macosko et al. 2015.

A new dataset of whole olfactory mucosa scSeq was generated from adult male mice (8–12 weeks-old). All mouse husbandry and experiments were performed following institutional and federal guidelines and approved by Harvard Medical School’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Briefly, dissected main olfactory epithelium were cleaned up in 750 μl of EBSS (Worthington) and epithelium tissues were isolated in 750 μL of Papain (20 U/mL in EBSS) and 50 μL of DNase I (2000 U/mL). Tissue pieces were transferred to a 5 mL round-bottom tube (BD) and 1.75 mL of Papain and 450 μL of DNase I were added. After 1–1.5 hour incubation with rocking at 37°C, the suspension was triturated with a 5 mL pipette 15 times and passed through 40 μm cell strainer (BD) and strainer was washed with 1 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended with 4 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Cells were suspended with PBS + 0.01% BSA and concentration was measured by hemocytometer. 8 replicates of Drop-seq samples were sequenced across 5 runs on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.",38
39,"The aims of the experiment were to profile the cell types in the adult mouse cardiac interstitium (non-myocyte cells) and how they respond to myocardial infarction injury. Adult, male, Pdgfra +/GFP mice were subject to either a myocardial infarction or sham injury, with cells isolated from cardiac ventricles 3 or 7 days following surgery. We obtained scRNA-seq profiles of two cell fractions: total interstitial (non-myocyte) cell population (TIP) and FACS-sorted GFP+/Cd31- cells (GFP).","Aggregate count matrices for each cell fraction (TIP or GFP) were generated using the 10X Genomics CellRanger software (version 1.3.0). The CellRanger aggr program was run on the output from CellRanger count for data-sets from the respective cell fractions.Tissue from ventricles of male adult mice was enzymatically digested into a single cell suspension and viable GFP+ CD31- cells were isolated using FACS sorting. Briefly, hearts were minced and incubated in collagenase type II (Worthington, USA) at 37°C before to be filtered on 40μm strainers. Cells were then resuspended in red cell lysis buffer followed by dead cell removal and immunostaining for 15 minutes on ice with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies and followed by FACS sorting for mentioned markers. Immediately after cell sorting and counting, the cells were loaded on the 10x Chromium microfluidics chip (3-prime V2). Cells were loaded on the 10x Chromium system and single cell RNA seq libraries were generated following the manufacturer’s instructions.NextSeq500 Illumina.

40,"The heterogeneity of endothelial cells (ECs), lining blood vessels, across tissues remains incompletely inventoried. We constructed an atlas of >32,000 single-EC transcriptomic data from 11 tissues of the model organism Mus musculus. We propose a new classification of EC phenotypes based on transcriptome signatures and inferred putative biological features. We identified top-ranking markers for ECs from each tissue. ECs from different vascular beds (arteries, capillaries, veins, lymphatics) resembled each other across tissues, but only arterial, venous and lymphatic (not capillary) ECs shared markers, illustrating a greater heterogeneity of capillary ECs. We identified high-endothelial-venule and lacteal-like ECs in the intestines, and angiogenic ECs in healthy tissues. Metabolic transcriptomes of ECs differed amongst spleen, lung, liver, brain and testis, while being similar for kidney, heart, muscle and intestines. Within tissues, metabolic gene expression was heterogeneous amongst ECs from different vascular beds, altogether highlighting large EC heterogeneity.","scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v2 (10x Genomics; Pleasanton, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The aimed target cell recovery for each library was 5000 (except for soleus, aimed recovery of 3000 cells). Generated libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000, followed by de-multiplexing and mapping to the mouse genome (build mm10) using CellRanger (10x Genomics, version 2.1.1).Whole organs were dissected, followed by dissociation using tissue-specific digestion protocols. Samples were then enriched for endothelial cells (ECs) by magnetic bead sorting using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec). Next, positive selection of ECs was performed using CD31 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec), followed by staining with various antibody combinations for multi-parameter flow acquisition. FACS-purification of ECs was then performed, and single cell suspensions of freshly isolated ECs were then resuspended in PBS containing 0.04% ultra-pure BSA.Samples were processed using V2 barcoding chemistry kits (10x Genomics). Single samples were always processed in a single well of a PCR plate, allowing all cells from a sample to be treated similarly. All samples were processed in parallel in the same thermal cycler.Data were aggregated using Cell Ranger and data from the raw unfiltered matrix was natural-log transformed using log1p and normalized using the Seurat package.",40
41,"We characterized single-cell transcriptional profiles of heart ventricles of C57BL/6J female and male mice subjected to a chronic stress, two weeks of continuous administration of Angiotensin II. The cell preparation we sequenced consisted of  metabolically active, nucleated non-myocyte cells which were depleted of endothelial cells, mixed with nuclei isolated from cardiomyocytes. The goal of this experiment included characterizing cellular diversity in stressed and unstressed hearts, uncovering potential drivers of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, and quantifying sexual dimorphism in cardiac gene expression.","Mice were fed standard diet ad libitum prior to isolation of tissues. Treatment of the mice was achieved by subcutaneous implantation of osmotic pumps (Alzet, model 2002) loaded with angiotensin II or vehicle. AngII was administered at 1.5mg/kg/day for two weeks after implantation of the pump. Male and female mice were sacrified at 10 weeks of age.   For simultaneous isolations of cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes, we adapted a protocol previously described for perfusion-based dissociation of the heart (Ackers-Johnson et al., 2016). Recipes for all buffers used can be found in the aforementioned protocol with the following modifications, 2-3, butanedione monoxime (BDM) was replaced with 5mM blebbistatin (SigmaAldrich) and [0.1U/µL] murine RNase inhibitor (NEB) was also supplemented.  One-hour prior to tissue harvest, mice were administered an intraperitoneal heparin injection at 1 mg/kg bodyweight. Following euthanasia of mice by CO2 asphyxiation, thoracic cavities were opened and inferior vena cava cut to allow exsanguination, before injecting 7 ml of EDTA buffer le. Following perfusion, aortas were clamped using a hemostat and cut to extract hearts. The hemostat was subsequently placed on a 3D-printed platform enabling hearts to be suspended above a waste fluid collection reservoir, with apex of the heart pointing upwards. To perfuse fluid, a hypodermic needle, connected to a peristaltic pump through the 3D-printed platform  which enabled it to be orientated above the heart, was inserted to the left ventricular chamber through the cardiac apex. Once the hearts were cannulated, EDTA buffer was pumped through using a peristaltic pump (~1ml/heart/min) until blood cleared (~5 min) before perfusion with enzyme digest cocktail for 15 minutes, during which time cardiac tissue was basted with fresh digestion buffer to prevent desiccation of the tissue. All buffers were maintained at 37°C during perfusion.   Following tissue digestion, cardiac ventricles were isolated by removing aorta and atria, and the ventricular digestion was finished by gently pulling apart the tissue before a 5-minute incubation at 37oC followed by trituration with a 1000 µL pipette. The cell suspension was then passed through a 250 µM filter to remove large undigested debris and brought to 15 mL with cold perfusion buffer supplemented with 5% FBS in a conical tube. Three consecutive minute-long centrifugation sedimentations at 50g, 4C were performed to separate cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes based on cell mass. The supernatant from each sedimentation step was collected and pooled in a 50 mL tube which was then centrifuged at 400g, 4C for 5 minutes to pellet the non-myocyte fraction of cells. Whole intact non-myocyte cells then underwent antibody and viability dye staining before flow cytometry or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), as described previously.  Cardiomyocyte nuclei were isolated by swelling cardiomyocytes in a hypotonic solution (91 mM NaCl, 5.3 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.293 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES at pH7.4) before triturating cells using a 30-gauge hypodermic needle to mechanically fragment cells. Nuclei were then isolated by filtration through a 20-µm cell strainer (pluriStrainer) to further fragment cells and exclude large debris. Finally, cell fragments were centrifuged at 1000g for 5 minutes before staining with DAPI, followed by FACS for isolation of nuclei.   Intact non-myocyte cells and cardiomyocyte nuclei from each heart were mixed and used for single cell transcriptomic library preparation on the Chromium controller.For each sample, ~12,000 cells were loaded for capture onto the Chromium System using the v2 single cell reagent kit (10X Genomics). Following capture and lysis, cDNA was synthesized and amplified (12 cycles) as per manufacturer's protocol (10X Genomics).Amplified cDNA was used to construct a sequencing library according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina).Library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.The cellranger software (version 2.1; 10X genomics) was used to convert raw fastq files into integer read counts for each gene in each cell. This file gives raw read counts output directly from cellranger and converted into a plain-text tab-delimited file. The file contains read counts for all cells that passed cellranger quality control checks from both biological samples sequenced.",41
42,Metastatic uveal melanoma generally responds poorly to immunotherapy. The aim here was to sequence tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from uveal melanoma metastases to study their phenotypes and T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes. We performed paired single-cell transcriptome and TCR sequencing using the 10x Genomics platform of IL2-expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from 7 liver and 1 subcutaneous metastasis.,"Small pieces of tumor biopsies were cultured for two weeks in TIL medium (RPMI1640 containing 10% human serum and 6000 U/ml IL-2). Young TIL (yTIL) cultures were then cryopreserved before use. Two days before performing the single cell experiments, yTIL cultures were thawed and cultured in TIL medium containing 600 U IL-2.Cells were counted and 7 000 cells were injected into a single cell library preparation instrument (10x Genomics). Single cells were isolated into barcoded gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) using Chromium microfluidic chips (Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit, PN: 1000009, 10x Genomics), after which barcodes and sample index sequences were ligated to transcripts. Barcoded first-strand cDNA were then purified using magnetic beads and amplified with PCR.5' expression libraries were generated, according to the kit descriptions provided by 10x Genomics, from amplified cDNA using the following kits: Chromium Single Cell 3'/5' Library Construction Kit (PN: 1000020, 10x Genomics), Chromium Single Cell 5' Library & Gel Bead Kit (PN: 1000006), Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit (PN: 1000009, 10x Genomics) and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (PN: 120262, 10x Genomics)Gene expression libraries were run on a NextSeq instrument (Illumina).",42
43,"Non-lymphoid tissues (NLTs) harbour a pool of adaptive immune cells distinct from their counterparts in lymphoid tissues, and their development and phenotype remains largely unexplored. We used scRNA-seq to survey CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) and memory T (Tmem) cells in spleen, lymph nodes, skin and colon in an unbiased way, in mouse. This cross-tissues comparison allows us to obtain marker genes for immune populations in specific locations, as well as examine each population's heterogeneity. Additionally, a continuous phenotype of Treg migration can be modelled from the mouse data, unravelling the transcriptional stages through which these cells transition between tissues.","Sequencing data from Chromium 10x runs was aligned and quantified using the CellRanger software package with default parameters.We ran each sample on one lane of Illumina HiSeq 4000, following manufacturer’s recommendations.Droplet-based scRNA-seq datasets were produced using a Chromium system (10x Genomics), referred to as 10x. Cell populations of interest were sorted, manually counted, and their concentrations adjusted to enable the capture of ~5000 cells (except for skin Treg and Tmem, for which we aimed to capture ~300 each). The standard protocol for the 10x single cell 3’ kit (V2 chemistry) was followed and each cell population loaded onto a separate chip inlet.All organs were taken from the same pool of mice; 16 mice in total (10 females + 6 males). Isolation of mouse CD4+ T cells: Isolation of murine leukocytes for steady-state skin dataset: To isolate leukocytes from ear tissue, ears were removed at the base, split into halves and cut into very small pieces. Tissue was digested in 3.5ml RPMI media with 0.1% BSA, 15mM Hepes, 1mg/ml collagenase D (Roche) and 450μg/ml Liberase TL (Roche) for 60 minutes at 37°C in a shaking incubator at 200rpm. Digested tissue was passed through an 18G needle to further disrupt the tissue and release cells. Cells were passed through a 70μm cell strainer, and the digestion was terminated by addition of ice-cold RPMI containing 0.1%BSA and 5mM EDTA. A three-layer (30/40/70%) Percoll density-gradient was used to enrich for the lymphocytes. Cells obtained from the digestion were layered in the 30% layer on top of the 40% and 70% layers, and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1800rpm without brake.

45,Single-nucleus RNA-seq resolves spatiotemporal developmental trajectories in the tomato shoot apex -scRNAseq,"Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Novaseq6000 platform with 150 paired-end reads. Approximately 20,000 nuclei were loaded for encapsulation. The library was constructed according to the manufacture’s instruction using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v3.The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv. M82 was used. The seeds were sterilized with 40% bleach and geminated on 1/2 MS medium with 1.5% phytagel in culture vessels at 23°C in long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark). Seedlings 2 weeks after gemination were dissected under a stereoscope. Shoot apices (SAM together with the first three primordia) were harvested and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use. Because leaf development is continuous, samples with early P4 were occasionally included. Shoot apices were resuspended in 10 ml nucleus isolated buffer (NIB: 10 mM MES-KOH (pH = 5.4), 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM DTT) with protease inhibitor cocktail (0.1%) and homogenized using a homogenizer at a low speed on ice. After lysis on ice for 30 min, the homogenate was filtered throughout a three-layer nylon mesh (Calbiochem) twice. To eliminate chloroplasts, 10% Triton X-100 was added dropwise to the solution to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) until most chloroplasts were degraded. Then the nucleus suspension was centrifugated at 1000 g for 5 min. The pelleted nuclei were washed twice and then suspended in NIB buffer (Extended Data Fig. 3). The procedure of snRNA-seq was shown in Fig. 1a. The variability, integrity, and concentration of the nuclei were determined by trypan blue staining and counted under a microscope.

46,"A subset of COVID-19 patients exhibit altered olfactory function. Here we analyze bulk and single cell RNA-Seq datasets to identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express cell entry molecules that mediate infection by SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the causal agent in COVID-19. We find that samples from whole olfactory mucosa in species including mouse and human express two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, neither olfactory sensory neurons nor olfactory bulb neurons express these genes, which are instead expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients. Two 15 min Drop-seq runs from a single dissociation of the olfactory bulbs were obtained from 2 mice. Two such dissociations were performed, giving 4 total replicates. Additional Drop-Seq data from the olfactory mucosa can be found in GSE151346.","UMI counts for each cell were obtained via the Drop-Seq Computational protocol, as described in http://mccarrolllab.org/dropseq/, using Picard and additional java programs as part of the Drop-seq_tools-1-2.0 pipeline. In brief, reads were demultiplexed, tagged with cell and UMI barcodes, and trimmed. Trimmed reads were aligned to the genome with STAR (v2.4.2a).

Dissected olfactory bulbs (including the accessory olfactory bulb and fractions of the anterior olfactory nucleus) were dissociated in 750 µl of dissociation media (DM: HBSS containing 10mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 33 mM D-glucose) with 28 U/mL Papain and 386 U/mL DNase I (Worthington). Minced tissue pieces were transferred to a 5 mL round-bottom tube (BD). DM was added to a final volume of 3.3 mL and the tissue was mechanically triturated 5 times with a P1000 pipette tip. After 1-hour incubation with rocking at 37°C, the suspension was triturated with a 10 mL pipette 10 times and 2.3 mL was passed through 40 µm cell strainer (BD). The suspension was then mechanically triturated with a P1000 pipette tip 10 times and 800 µL were filtered on the same strainer. The cell suspension was further triturated with a P200 pipette tip 10 times and filtered. 1 mL of Quench buffer (22 mL of DM, 2.5 mL of protease inhibitor prepared by resuspending 1 vial of protease inhibitor with 32 mL of DM, and 2000U of DNase I) was added to the suspension and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended with 3 mL of Quench buffer and overlaid gently on top of 5 mL of protease inhibitor, then spun down at 70g for 10min. The pellet was resuspended using DM supplemented with 0.04 % BSA, and spun down at 300g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 400-500 µL of DM with 0.04% BSA and the concentration was measured by hemocytometer, then diluted by DM with 0.04% BSA at a final concentration of 200 cells/µL. 4 replicates of Drop-seq samples were pooled and sequenced across 3 runs on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform",46

Demultiplexing according to the sample barcodes was done by mkfast from the Cellanger package. 2 fastq files were generated per sample. The R1 fastq contains the cell barcode and UMI i.e. the i7 (14nt, positions 1-14) and the i5 (10nt, positions 15-25) and the R2 which contains the cDNA (88nt).Samples were processed using kits pertaining to  V2 barcoding chemistry of 10X Genomics.Single cell suspensions were converted to barcoded Drop-seq libraries by using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library, Gel Bead & Multiplex Kit and Chip Kit (10X Genomics; Pleasanton, California, USA), aiming for an estimated 4,000 cells per library.Following resection in the operating room, samples from the tumour and adjacent lung tissue from the same resection specimen at maximal distance (>5 cm) from the tumour were isolated, and transported rapidly to the research facility. Upon arrival, samples were rinsed with PBS, and the tumour sample macroscopically examined for tumour positioning. The tumour sample was subsequently divided in 3 pieces, with one piece containing mainly tissue derived from the tumour core, one piece containing tissue mainly derived from the tumour edge, and a third piece originating from the position intermediate to both samples. Each sample was subsequently minced on ice to smaller pieces of less than 1 mm3, and transferred to 10 mL digestion medium. Samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C, with manual shaking every 5 minutes. Samples were then vortexed for 10 seconds, and pipetted up and down for 1 minute using pipettes of descending sizes (25 mL, 10 mL and 5 mL). Next, 30 mL ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS; ThermoFisher Scientific) containing 2% foetal bovine serum (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added, samples were filtered using a 40µm nylon mesh (ThermoFisher Scientific). Following centrifugation at 120 G at 4°C for 5 minutes, the supernatant was decanted and discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL red blood cell lysis buffer and transferred to a 2 mL DNA low bind tube. Following a 5-minute incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged (120 G, 4°C, 5 min) using a swing-out rotor.

49,"Tissue-resident immune cells are important for organ homeostasis and defence The epithelium may contribute to these functions directly, or via crosstalk with immune cells. We resolved the spatio-temporal immune topology of the human kidney with a scRNAseq dataset from 40,268 mature and 27,203 fetal kidney cells. Within the epithelial compartment there were zonated patterns of immune gene expression, with pelvic epithelial anti-microbial peptide expression in mature but not fetal kidneys. Tissue-resident immune cells were evident in both fetal and mature kidney, with post-natal acquisition of infection-defense capabilities. Epithelial-immune signalling orchestrated localization of macrophages and neutrophils to regions of the kidney susceptible to infection.","Fetal material was obtained from both medical (pharmacologically induced) and surgical termination of pregnancy.Isolated fetal kidneys were cut into into <1mm3 segments and digested with 1.6mg/mL collagenase type IV (Worthington) in RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37 °C with intermittent shaking.

50,"Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we have built a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for the adult Drosophila ovary and connected tissues. A total of 429,855,892 reads were obtained with 28,995 mean reads per cell for the final dataset of 7,053 high-quality cells containing an overall 11,782 genes. Using this dataset, we identified the transcriptional trajectory of the entire follicle cell population over the course of their development from stem cells to the oogenesis-to-ovulation transitioning phase in the Corpus luteum. We further identify expression patterns during essential developmental events which take place in somatic and germline cell types such as differentiation, cell-cycle switching, migration, symmetry breaking, nurse cell engulfment, egg-shell formation, and corpus luteum signaling. Extensive experimental validation of unique expression patterns in both ovarian and non-ovarian cells also led to the identification of many new markers specific to cell-type and stage. The inclusion of several nearby tissue types in this dataset also led to our identification of functional convergence in expression between distantly related cell types such as the immune-related genes which were similarly expressed in immune cells (hemocytes) and ovarian somatic cells (stretched cells) during their brief phagocytic role in nurse cell engulfment. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the temporal regulation of genes in a cell-type specific manner during oogenesis and begin to reveal the relatedness in expression between cell and tissues types. scRNA-seq (10x Genomics CHROMIUM Single Cell 3’ Solution V2 Chemistry and Illumina NovaSeq 6000) of adult ovaries from female Drosophila melanogaster flies.","Illumina Casava1.7 software used for base-calling Genome index for single cell analysis was built using the Drosophila melanogaster Release 6 (dm6) reference genome assembly using 10X genomics cellranger (version 3.0.0) mkref pipeline.

51,"Differentiation is among the most fundamental processes in cell biology. Single cell RNA-seq studies have demonstrated that differentiation is a continuous process and in particular cell states are observed to reside on largely continuous spaces. We have developed Palantir, a graph based algorithm to model continuities in cell state transitions and cell fate choices. Modeling differentiation as a Markov chain, Palantir determines probabilities of reaching terminal states from cells in each intermediate state. The entropy of these probabilities represent the differentiation potential of the cell in the corresponding state. Applied to single cell RNA-seq dataset of CD34+ hematopoietic cells from human bone marrows, Palantir accurately identified key events leading up to cell fate commitment. Integration with ATAC-seq data from bulk sorted populations helped identify key regulators that correlate with cell fate specification and commitment.","Cryopreserved bone marrow stem/progenitor CD34+ cells from healthy donors were purchased from AllCells, LLC.

53,"The human testis undergoes dramatic developmental and structural changes during puberty, including proliferation and maturation of niche/somatic cells, and the onset of spermatogenesis. Here, we profiled and analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of ~10,000 testicular cells from four boys spanning puberty, and compared to infants and adults. During puberty, undifferentiated spermatogonia first expand and then differentiate, prior to gametogenesis. Notably, we identify a common pre-pubertal progenitor for Leydig and myoid cells, and reveal candidate factors/pathways for pubertal differentiation. Furthermore, pre-pubertal Sertoli cells form two states that differ in mitochondrial/metabolic transcription, which converge to a single mature population during puberty. Roles for testosterone in Sertoli cell maturation, antimicrobial peptide secretion and spermatogonial differentiation are revealed through analyses of testosterone-suppressed transgender female testis and via in vitro seminiferous tubule culturing. Overall, our transcriptional atlas of the developing human testis provides major insights into developmental changes and key factors/pathways that accompany male puberty.

54,"Root development relies on the establishment of meristematic tissues that give rise to distinct cell types that differentiate across defined temporal and spatial gradients. Dissection of the developmental trajectories and the transcriptional networks that underlie them is therefore crucial for better understanding of the function of the root apical meristem in both dicots and monocots. Here we performed a single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing and chromatin accessibility survey of rice radicles. The temporal profiling of individual root tip cells enabled the reconstruction of continuous developmental trajectories of epidermal cells and ground tissues, and elucidation of the regulatory networks underlying cell fate determination of these cell lineages. We further identified characteristic processes, transcriptome profiles, and marker genes for these cell types and used them to reveal conserved and divergent root developmental pathways between dicots and monocots.

Cells were centrifuged at 1300rpm for 5min, washed and then resuspended in GBSS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich cat A2153). The cell suspension was centrifuged, decanted and resuspended into 8ml 28.7% (wt/vol) solution of Nycodenz (Sigma, no longer available. Also used 16.7% Optiprep[Sigma-Aldrich D1556]) overlayed with 6ml .3% BSA GBSS, then centrifuged at 1400g with no break for 20 min. The cells of interest separated into a fuzzy band just above the interface of the Nycodenz cushion and the GBSS. This band was harvested, and the cells were washed and resuspended in MACs buffer.Samples were stained and sorted for CD45-, TER119-, CD24a-, CD31-, 7AAD-, Calcein Violet+, PDPN+. Sorted single-cell suspensions were converted to barcoded scRNA-seq libraries by using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library, Gel Bead & Multiplex Kit and Chip Kit (10x Genomics), loading an estimated 6,000 cells per library and following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were processed using kits pertaining to either the V2 barcoding chemistry of 10x Genomics.Single samples were processed in a single well of a PCR plate, allowing all cells from a sample to be treated with the same master mix and in the same reaction vessel. For each replicate, all samples (non-malignant and tumor) were processed in parallel in the same thermal cycler. The final libraries were profiled using the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies) and quantified using the Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems).Single-cell RNA-seq data for each replicate were processed with cellranger count 745 (CellRanger 2.1.0 [10x Genomics]) using a custom reference package based on mouse 746 reference genome GRCm38 and GENCODE gene models.

57,"We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a cell census of the human thymus during development, early childhood and adult life. We sampled 15 embryonic and fetal thymi spanning thymic developmental stages between 7 post-conception weeks (PCW) to 17 PCW, and 9 postnatal thymi from paediatric and adult samples. We compared the cellular composition and T cell differentiation within human and mouse thymus using newly generated and repository mouse datasets. Finally, we investigated the bias in the recombination and selection of human versus mouse TCR repertoires.","All tissues were processed immediately after isolation using consistent protocols with variation in enzymatic digestion strength. Tissue was transferred to a sterile 10mm2 tissue culture dish and cut into <1mm3 segments before being transferred to a 50mL conical tube. For mild digestion, tissues were digested with 1.6mg/mL collagenase type IV (Worthington) in RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10%(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2mM L-Glutamine (Sigma- Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37°C with intermittent shaking. For stringent digestion, tissue was digested with 0.2 mg/ml Liberase ™ (Roche)/0.125 KU DNase1 (Sigma-Aldrich)/10mM HEPES in RPMI for 30 minutes at 37°C with intermittent shaking. The dissociated cells were separated and remaining undigested tissues were digested again with fresh media. This procedure was repeated until the tissue were completely dissociated. Digested tissue was passed through a 100μm filter, and cells collected by centrifugation (500g for 5 minutes at 4°C). Cells were treated with 1X red blood cell (RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 5 minutes at room temperature and washed once with flow buffer (PBS containing 5%(v/v) FBS and 2mM EDTA) prior to cell counting. Isolated thymus cells were stained with a panel of antibodies prior to sorting based on a CD45 or CD3 expression gate. The anti-human monoclonal antibodies used for flow cytometry based immunophenotyping and FAC sorting are listed in Table S1. An antibody cocktail was freshly prepared by adding 3μL of each antibody in 50μL Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD) per tissue. Cells (≤10x106) were resuspended in 50-100μL flow buffer and an equal volume of antibody mix was added to cells from each tissue. Cells were stained for 30 minutes on ice, washed with flow buffer and resuspended at 10x106 cells/mL. Immediately prior to sorting, DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 3μM and cells strained through a 35μm filter. Flow sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria™ Fusion instrument using DIVA V8, and data analysed using FlowJo V10.4.1. Cells were gated to remove dead cells and doublets, and then sorted for 10X or SS2 scRNAseq analysis. For 10X droplet microfluidic analysis, cells were sorted into chilled FACS tubes coated with FBS and prefilled with 500μL sterile PBS. Paediatric samples were sorted into 50% FCS and 50% IMDM medium (supplemented with 1% glu, 1%P/S and 10% FCS). Enrichment of EPCAM positive cells were performed using CD326 (EPCAM) microbeads (Miltenyl Biotec., 130-061-101) according to manufacturer’s protocol. CD45 depleted cells were obtained using CD45 microbeads (Miltenyl Biotec., 130-045-801) according to manufacturer’s protocol.

From our merged data, we excluded genes with less than 100 transcripts or expressed in less than 10 cells and cells having less than 2000 genes, more than 50000 transcripts or more than 12% of mitochondria reads. The resulting dataset consisted of 15325 cells and 16179 genes. For clustering and visualization purposes we normalized by correcting for sequencing depth biases and log-transforming the gene expression matrix. For regression analysis and gene clustering we imported the raw expression data after QC and used Monocle3 default normalization workflow (Cao et al., 2019).The single-cell expression matrix was exported from the FASTQ files using the CellRanger pipeline using CellRanger’s 2 cell calling algorithm. For aligning and gene annotation we used the GRCh38 v1.2.0 assembly from 10x Genomics.

60,"Intestinal mesenchymal cells play essential roles in epithelial homeostasis, matrix remodeling, immunity, and inflammation. But the extent of heterogeneity within the colonic mesenchyme in these processes remains unknown. Using unbiased single-cell profiling of over 16,500 colonic mesenchymal cells, we reveal four subsets of fibroblasts expressing divergent transcriptional regulators and functional pathways, in addition to pericytes and myofibroblasts. We identified a niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3 (CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity in vivo. Our work defines how the colonic mesenchyme remodels to fuel inflammation and barrier dysfunction in IBD.","Colonic biopsy samples were collected from patients attending clinically indicated endoscopy procedures at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUHFT) following written informed consent.The biopsies were dissociated using a human Umbilical Cord Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's protocol for fresh tissue with some modifications. Incubation time was reduced to 2 hours and mechanical dissociation was achieved by passing the suspension through an 18 gauge needle 5–10 times every 60 minutes. Depletion of non-stromal cell types was achieved by MACS separation following the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. The stromal fraction was enriched by MACS-depletion of CD45+, EpCAM+ and CD235a + cells. The resultant stromal cell suspension was passed through a 70 μm cell strainer.

63,"Purpose: The goals of this study were to identify cell specific expression patterns of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and a variety of choroidal cell types originating from the macula and the periphery of human donor eyes, with a particular emphasis on identifying expression signatures of choroidal endothelial cells. Methods: Independent libraries were prepared for macular and peripheral samples of combined RPE/choroid from seven donors in two single cell sequencing experiments. In the first experiment, 8-mm macular and peripheral punches of RPE/choroid from Donors 1-3 were digested in papain prior to cryopreservation and subsequent GEM barcoding/library construction. Donors 1-2 had no noted ophthalmologic disease documented, while Donor 3 was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration. In the second experiment, 12-mm macular and peripheral punches of RPE/choroid from Donors 4-7 were digested in collagenase II prior to cryopreservation, CD31-magentic bead enrichment and subsequent GEM barcoding/library construction. Donors 5-7 had no noted ophthalmologic disease documented, while Donor 4 was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration. In both experiments, libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq4000. Sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome build hg19 will CellRanger(v3.0.1) and filters removed cells likely to be doublets or cells with a high proportion of mitochondrial reads. Clustering of cells with similar expression profiles was performed with Seurat (v3.0.2). Results: In the first experiment with unenriched RPE/choroid from donors 1-3, we recovered 4,355 cells post filtering with 40,177,477 corresponding reads. A total of 2,167 cells originated from the macula and 2,168 cells originated from the periphery. A total of 11 clusters were identified, and highly enriched genes in each cluster were used to classify clusters into their presumed dominant cell type. Differential expression analysis was performed between cells of macular and peripheral origin in each cluster and between donors with and without a history of age-related macular degeneration. Results: In the second experiment with CD31-enriched RPE/choroid from donors 4-7, we recovered 14,234 cells post filtering with 135,742,297 corresponding reads. A total of 7,647 cells originated from the macula and 6,587 cells originated from the periphery. A total of 8,521 of these cells were presumed endothelial cells. A total of 13 clusters were identified, and highly enriched genes in each cluster were used to classify clusters into their presumed dominant cell type(s). Differential expression analysis was performed between cells of macular and peripheral origin in each cluster and between donors with and without a history of age-related macular degeneration. Within each of the endothelial clusters (Clusters 5-8), differential expression analysis was performed between each cluster and the remaining endothelial cells. Conclusions: This study provides a large atlas of single-cell level gene expression patterns of the human retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal cell types. We identify expression patterns of most expected choroidal cell populations and describe macular versus peripheral regional differences. We additionally identify enriched transcripts in specific cell populations in age-related macular degeneration. We characterize gene expression patterns along the choroidal vascular tree, and identify populations of arterial, capillary, and venous endothelial cells. Our results show that single-cell sequencing can be performed on human RPE/choroid after cryopreservation, and that CD31 magnetic bead enrichment can be employed to enrich for endothelial cells for single-cell sequencing. mRNA profiles for thousands of cells from macular and peripheral RPE/choroid isolates were generated from seven human donor eyes using 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell system followed by sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.","FASTQ files were generated from the raw BCL files using Illumina’s bcl2fastq conversion program.

70,"Splenic white pulp (WP) structures are underpinned by fibroblastic stromal cells (FSCs) to facilitate splenic compartmentalization and execute efficient immune responses. Although distinct WP FSCs exhibit various molecular traits, the origin and the hierarchical differentiation of different cell subsets are not characterized. Here we showed, the organization of splenic WP and the differentiation of WP FSCs were governed by lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling pathway. Cell fate mapping analysis revealed that different WP fibroblastic stromal cells descend from a common perivascular LTβR-sensitive mesenchymal lymphoid organizer cells (mLTo) at prenatal stage. Moreover, embryonic mLTo cells required LTβR signaling to give rise to different WP stromal cell subsets, while the proliferation of these cells was devoid of LTβR signaling but followed the development of WP during ontogeny. Moreover, cell fate mapping from different time point indicated a consecutive commitment of mLTo cells initiated from the proximal region around the splenic artery. RNAseq and differentiation trajectory analysis of distinct FSCs showed that Ltbr-deficient cells and perivascular reticular cells (PRCs) from adult spleen exhibited a progenitor phenotype and revealed a closer hierarchical lineage with embryonic mLTo cells. Taken together, our results unveil that embryonic mLTo cells residing in the perivascular niches can give rise to different FSC populations in a LTβR-dependent manner during development.","The cDNA library generation is performed by functional genomic center Zurich following the established commercial protocol for Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit (v2 Chemistry) (Catalogue Number PN-120237).Preprocessing and gene expression estimation was performed using CellRanger (v2.1.1), generating UMI counts for 8,364 cells and 26,596 genes with a count above zero in at least one cell.

Here we report studies of a patient with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) carrying persistent CD4+ T cell clonal expansion which harbored somatic mTOR, NFKB2, and TLR2 mutations. Functional analysis of the discovered mTOR mutation indicated a gain-of-function alteration and activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways leading to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and real-time impedance measurements supported increased cytotoxicity of mutated CD4+ T cells.

74,"Optimal plant growth is hampered by limiting amounts of the essential macronutrient phosphate in most soils. As a response, plant roots produce root hairs to capture this immobile nutrient. Although vital to high-yielding crops, this response remains poorly understood. By generating and exploiting a high spatial and temporal resolution single cell atlas of the Arabidopsis root, we show a remarkable enrichment of TMO5/LHW target genes in root hair epidermal cells. Moreover, these vascular bHLH factors are sufficient to induce a root hair formation response in the epidermal cells, similar as observed during low phosphate conditions, via the downstream cytokinin signaling. We further show that root hair formation under low phosphate conditions is almost absent when TMO5 function or cytokinin signaling is perturbed. In conclusion, cytokinin signaling links the adaptation of roots under low phosphate conditions in the epidermis to perception in vascular cells.

Briefly, whole Arabidopsis roots were finely chopped with a Feather Disposable Scalpel #10 (Andwin Scientific, Schaumburg, IL) and distributed among 70-μm cell strainers (each containing 1,250-1,500 roots). Blades were changed every 5 to 6 plates to prevent dulling of the blade and consequent bruising of the tissue. Each strainer was then immersed in a solution of cellulysin (MilliporeSigma) and pectolyase (MilliporeSigma) for 60 minutes with agitation at 85 rpm on an orbital shaker at room temperature. After cell wall digestion, each strainer, containing remnants of roots that were not protoplasted, was removed and discarded. Protoplasts were then pelleted, resuspended, and filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer to eliminate any clumped cells.

90,"Plant root architecture is a major determinant of fitness, and is under constant modification in response to favorable and unfavorable environmental stimuli. Beyond impacts on the primary root, the environment can also alter the position, spacing, density, and length of secondary or lateral roots. Lateral root development is among the best-studied developmental processes in Arabidopsis thaliana, yet the earliest steps of organogenesis remain elusive. Among the challenges faced in capturing these early molecular events is the fact that this process occurs in a small number of cells with unpredictable timing. The advent of single-cell sequencing affords the opportunity to isolate cells undergoing this fate transition and examine their transcriptomes independently. Using this approach, we successfully captured the transcriptomes of lateral root primordia and discovered many previously unreported upregulated genes. To further study this process, we developed a method to selectively repress genes in the xylem pole pericycle cells where lateral roots originate. We found that expression of several of the upregulated genes was required for normal root development. In addition, we discovered a subpopulation of cells in the endodermal cell file that respond to lateral root initiation, further highlighting the benefits of the single cell approach. Using the 10X single cell transcriptomics platform, we isolated cells from Arabidopsis roots to study lateral root formation. To stimulate lateral root formation, Arabidopsis seedlings were rotated 90 degrees and cells from the root bend were captured 08 hours, and 20 hours after the stimulus.

91,"Leaves are asymmetric, with differential functionalization of abaxial and adaxial tissues. The bundle sheath (BS) surrounding the vasculature of the C3 crop barley is dorsoventrally differentiated into three domains: adaxial structural, lateral S-type, and abaxial L-type. S-type cells seem to transfer assimilates towards the phloem. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate BS differentiation in C4 maize. Abaxial BS (abBS) cells of rank-2 intermediate veins specifically expressed three SWEET sucrose uniporters (SWEET13a, b, and c) and UmamiT amino acid efflux transporters. SWEET13a, b, c were also identified in the phloem parenchyma (PP). Thus maize acquired a unique mechanism for phloem loading in which abBS cells provide the main pathway for apoplasmic sucrose transfer towards the phloem. This pathway predominates in veins responsible for phloem loading (rank-2 intermediate), while rank-1 intermediate and major veins export sucrose from the phloem parenchyma (PP) adjacent to the sieve element companion cell (SE/CC) complex, as in Arabidopsis. We surmise that abBS identity is subject to dorsoventral patterning and has components of PP identity. The observations provide first insights into the unique properties of abBS cells, cells previously considered to fulfill the same functions as other bundle sheath cells (BSCs), and a basis for understanding the C4 syndrome.

92,"We assessed the pluripotency of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) maintained on an automated platform using StemFlexTM and TeSRTM-E8TM media. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing was performed for 20,962 cells from two cell lines grown in the two media. Analysis of transcriptomic profile revealed similar expression of core pluripotency genes, as well as genes associated with naive and primed states of pluripotency. Single cell analysis of the four samples revealed a shared subpopulation structure with three main subpopulations different in pluripotency states. By implementing a machine learning approach, we estimated that 60-96% of the cells in the ground/naive subpopulations and 98-99% of the cells in the primed subpopulations are similar between all four samples. The single cell RNA sequencing analysis of iPSC lines grown in both media is the first report of the molecular pathways modulated in StemFlex medium and how they compare to those modulated in TeSR-E8 medium.","Library construction were performed according to 10X standard protocol.  Human skin biopsies were obtained from subjects over the age of 18 years.Cells were harvested using ReleSRTM, colonies were dissociated into single cell suspension. Cells were counted and assessed for viability with Trypan Blue using a Countess II automated counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific), then pooled at a concentration of 391-663 cells/µL (3.91x10^5-6.63x10^5 cells/mL). Final cell viability estimates ranged between 85-97%. Cells were partitioned and barcoded using high-throughput droplet 10X Genomics ChromiumTM Controller (10X Genomics, USA) and the Single Cell 3' Library and Gel Bead Kit (V2  10X Genomics PN-120237). GEM generation and barcoding, cDNA amplification, and library construction were performed according to standard protocol.  Total number of cells for clustering 20,962.We normalised the transcript data on three levels: between samples, and between cells. To account for variation in total read depth per sample, we used a subsampling process based on the sample index, cell barcodes, and UMIs to randomly sample from a binomial distribution to the level of individual reads. This approach maintains the distribution of reads mapped per gene, per cell and per sample, and equalizes the total read-depth between samples. This method has been shown to be less biased than other global-scaling methods, which use information from the final mapped expression matrix only - i.e. total reads mapped per sample and distributions of expression levels in a sample (Zheng et al., 2016, Nat Communications).  After between sample normalisation, a deconvolution and pooling approach was performed to normalise read depth between cells. This method overcome the inflation of zero count measures in the expression matrix of scRNA-seq data (otherwise known as dropout rate), by sequentially pooling 40, 60, 80 and 100 cells. The expression levels of a transcript are summed to estimates a size factor for each pool. Pool size factors are then deconvoluted into the size factors of individual cells.  Briefly, to estimate the scaling size factor for each cell, a deconvolution method (Lun et al., 2016, Genome Biol.) was applied for summation of gene expression in groups of cells. This summation approach reduced the number of stochastic zero expression of genes that are lowly expressed (higher dropout rates), or genes that are turned on/off in different subpopulations of cells. (Illumina BCL files) was processed directly with the cellranger pipeline v2.0.0 (mkfastq, count, aggr) using the default parameters, except for the estimated cell number set at 5,000 cells. The reads were aligned to the homo sapiens GRCh38p10 Cell Ranger 2.0 reference genome using the STAR software. Cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) were filtered using default parameters in the cellranger count processing. Reads with > 90% base calling accuracy were kept and UMI sequences were corrected based on high-quality sequenced UMIs with Hamming distance 1. A gene count expression matrix for four samples was generated using the cellranger aggr function.",92

T cells developing in humanized NSG-SGM3 mice were retrieved from spleen and bone marrow, activated and transduced ex vivo to express CD19-targeting CAR molecule (HuSGM3 CD19 CAR-T). After transduction and expansion, HuSGM3 CD19 CAR-T cells were infused back into NSG-SGM3 mice previously co-engrafted with human cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and with ALL-CM leukaemia cells. After HuSGM3 CD19 CAR-T cell infusion, spleen from leukaemic and humanized SGM3 recipient was dissociated and cells subjects to FACS sorting.

94,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) causes a wide variety of developmental defects in the neonate which can lead to heart disease, diabetes, anxiety and other disorders later in life. The effect of FGR on the immune system, however, is poorly understood. Immune cells throughout development are identified using cell-surface markers to distinguish between subtly different stages. These (surface) proteins, however, do not necessarily generate differences in cellular activity and may thus be only a coincidental shallow guide to classifying cells. High-throughput single-cell transcriptomics using DropSeq was performed on mouse neonate thymuses. The T-cell population was selected through flow cytometry in wild type controls and a placental specific isoform of Igf2 knock-down (igf2-p0). Using this analysis, we discovered skewed T-cell populations in the growth restricted murine neonate indicating a developmental delay. This finding recapitulates the altered immunity found in growth restricted human infants. The T-cell deficit persisted into adulthood, even when body and organ weights approached normal levels due to catch-up growth. This reduction in T-cellularity may have significant implications in adult immunity, adding to the wide variety of fetal origins for adult disease already known.","Exon U2 was deleted from the Igf2 locus to prevent expression of the placenta-specific Igf2 transcript, P0. This gene is paternally expressed, so by crossing wild type females with heterozygous males, both wild type and affected neonates grow within the same environment.Samples were analysed for size distribution and concentration and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 with an Index read of 8bp, Read 1 of 25 bp and Read 2 of 100 bp.DNA was fragmented and tagged with Illumina adapter and index sequencers using Nextera Sequencing kit and 600 pg DNA/sample. Samples were diluted 1:1 in ddH20 water before double-sided purification with Agencourt Ampure beads using 0.6x beads to remove large fragments and 1x beads twice to remove contaminating primers.Single cells were encapsulated in droplets with primer barcoded beads. After RNA binding to the oligo-dT portion of the primer, the droplets were broken to pool beads for reverse transcription. Exonuclease treatment removed unused primers from the beads prior to PCR amplification at up to 8,000 beads / tube (~400 cells/tube).

95,Single-nucleus RNA-seq resolves spatiotemporal developmental trajectories in the tomato shoot apex - snRNAseq,"Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Novaseq6000 platform with 150 paired-end reads. Approximately 20,000 nuclei were loaded for encapsulation. The library was constructed according to the manufacture’s instruction using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v3.The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv. M82 was used. The seeds were sterilized with 40% bleach and geminated on 1/2 MS medium with 1.5% phytagel in culture vessels at 23°C in long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark). Seedlings 2 weeks after gemination were dissected under a stereoscope. Shoot apices (SAM together with the first three primordia) were harvested and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use. Because leaf development is continuous, samples with early P4 were occasionally included. Shoot apices were resuspended in 10 ml nucleus isolated buffer (NIB: 10 mM MES-KOH (pH = 5.4), 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM DTT) with protease inhibitor cocktail (0.1%) and homogenized using a homogenizer at a low speed on ice. After lysis on ice for 30 min, the homogenate was filtered throughout a three-layer nylon mesh (Calbiochem) twice. To eliminate chloroplasts, 10% Triton X-100 was added dropwise to the solution to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) until most chloroplasts were degraded. Then the nucleus suspension was centrifugated at 1000 g for 5 min. The pelleted nuclei were washed twice and then suspended in NIB buffer (Extended Data Fig. 3). The procedure of snRNA-seq was shown in Fig. 1a. The variability, integrity, and concentration of the nuclei were determined by trypan blue staining and counted under a microscope. The nuclei concentration was adjusted to ~1000 cells/μl with NIB and subject for encapsulation with the 10x Genomics Single cell cassette according to the manufacture’s instruction.",95
96,"Drosophila blood cells, called the hemocytes, are composed of three distinct cell populations: plasmatocytes (PM), crystal cells (CC), and lamellocytes (LM). These cell types have been extensively characterized based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire. Further, intermediate states along the course of maturation of these cell types have been poorly characterized. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the Drosophila larval hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions. We identified all known cell types, resolved PMs into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the detection of CC and LM intermediates. Further, we discovered rare cells within CC and LM populations that express the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand branchless (bnl) and receptor breathless (btl), respectively. We demonstrate that both bnl and btl are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs in vivo, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocyte populations and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions. inDrops, 10x Genomics Chromium, and Drop-seq based single-cell RNA-sequencing of ~20K hemocytes from the Drosophila larvae across different inflammatory conditions","Paired-end reads were processed and mapped to the reference genome BDGP 6.02 (Ensembl September 2014) following the Drop-seq Core Computational Protocol version 1.2 (January 2016) and corresponding Drop-seq tools version 1.13 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq) (December 2017) provided by McCarroll Lab (http://mccarrolllab.org/dropseq/). The Picard suite (https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard) was used to generate the unaligned bam files which were processed using the Drop-seq_alignment.sh script. The steps include detection of barcode and UMI sequences, filtration and trimming of low-quality bases and adaptors or poly-A tails, and alignment of reads using STAR (2.5.3a).OreR larvae were infested at 72 hr AEL with the wasps of the species Leptopilina boulardi, strain G486. Wasps were removed after 12 hr of co-culture and egg deposition was confirmed by direct observation of wasp eggs in the hemolymph during dissection. 100 larvae were dissected at 96 and 120 hr AEL, corresponding to 24 and 48 hr post infestation (wasp inf. 24 hr and 48 hr), respectively, in Schneider's medium (Gibco, cat# 21720024).Drop-seq was used to encapsulate the wasp inf. 24 hr samples (n = 3). The protocol for Drop-seq based encapsulation was followed as previously described (Macosko et al., 2015).Hemocytes from wasp infested larvae were isolated with some modifications, where the optiprep step was avoided to obtain higher number of cells. Briefly, after vortexing, the larvae were bled in ice cold Schneider’s medium, filtered through 100 μm cell strainer, and transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. Next, the cells were spun at 4°C for 5 min at 6000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were re-suspended in ice cold PBS to achieve a concentration of 300 cells/μl and subjected to Drop-seq based encapsulation.",96
97,"There are two main types of root systems in flowering plants, which are taproot systems in dicot and fibrous root systems in monocot. The cellular and molecular mechanism involved in root development are mainly from the study of dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana. However, mechanisms of root development and their conservation and divergence in monocot, which including the major crops, remain largely elusive. Here we profile the transcriptomes of more than 20,000 single cells in the root tips of two rice cultivars, Nipponbare (Nip; Japonica) and 93-11 (Indica). Single-cell analysis coupled with in situ hybridization identify the cell type-specific marker genes and annotate all the clusters.

Seeds were plated in rows with approximately 100 plants per row and two rows per plate. Plates where randomized using a random block design where each tray contained an equal number of control and treatment plates. After 7 days of growth, plants were transferred by mesh filters to either MS plates buffered to pH 5.8 with KOH or MS containing estradiol (0.01, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.13, 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20uM) plates and grown for an additional 24 hours (induction). All induction experiments were carried out at 7 am and collected at 7 am. Whole root samples were imaged, frozen for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR or protoplasted for Drop-seq. In all induction experiments, we made the assumption that each cell within the root (the population of cells) encounters approximately the same mean concentration of β-estradiol and thus, VND7 expression.Whole roots were separated from shoots and collected in bulk from each plate for RNA extraction. RNA for qRT-PCR was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was DNase treated prior to cDNA synthesis using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was used as a template for real-time quantitative PCR analysis. Each plate was considered an independent biological replicate with at least three biological replicates (same estradiol concentration & grown same day) per dilution series. Log2 Fold Change (FC) of VND7 varied 0.041 - 0.57 standard deviations (SD) among biological replicates. The largest variance was observed under lower induction of VND7 (2-4 FC) with the SD ranging from 0.08-0.57 SD, in mid-expression lines (5-7 FC) 0.041-0.064 SD. The 2ΔΔCT method was used to measure relative transcript abundance (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008). Three technical replicates were carried out and averaged for each plate. VND7 expression was normalized to Actin to determine the delta CT and the delta delta CT was determined from uninduced roots grown on the same rack.

99,"Mucosal-Associated Invariant T cells (MAIT cells) have a unique specificity for the microbial metabolite 5-OP-RU presented by the non-classical presentation molecule MR1. Upon activation, they release cytotoxic mediators and engage an antimicrobial activity. As a subset of T lymphocytes, MAIT development occurs in the thymus where they acquire their effector phenotype under the control of the key transcription factor ZBTB16. This particular maturation process is in contrast with conventional T cells that egress the thymus with a naive phenotype before populating the secondary lymphoid organs, and the molecular events driving the MAIT lineage decision are poorly known. In the present work, we evaluated the transcriptional events and the role of the slam-SAP pathway on the lineage decision of MR1-restricted T cells by single cell RNAseq.

101,"Here, we apply this approach to A. thaliana root cells to capture gene expression in 3,121 root cells. We analyze these data with Monocle 3, which orders single cell transcriptomes in an unsupervised manner and uses machine learning to reconstruct single-cell developmental trajectories along pseudotime. We identify hundreds of genes with cell-type-specific expression, with pseudotime analysis of several cell lineages revealing both known and novel genes that are expressed along a developmental trajectory. We identify transcription factor motifs that are enriched in early and late cells, together with the corresponding candidate transcription factors that likely drive the observed expression patterns. Finally, by applying heat stress to whole seedlings, we address the longstanding question of possible heterogeneity among cell types in the response to an abiotic stress. Although the response of canonical heat shock genes dominates expression across cell types, subtle but significant differences in other genes can be detected among cell types.

117,"Over 250 million people suffer from schistosomiasis, a tropical disease caused by parasitic flatworms known as schistosomes. To unravel the transcriptional signatures for the larval stage of this parasite, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on two-day old schistosomula. We described 15 populations and spatially validated our results using FISH.","Two days after transformation the schistosomula cultured in modified Basch’s media at 37°C and 5% CO2 were collected and processed in two separate batches (batch1 and batch2). Schistosomula collected from two different snail batches were considered biological replicates. Data collected as batch3 are ‘technical’ replicates of batch2 given they were collected on the same day and from the same pool of parasites. In each experiment, approximately 5,000 larvae were pooled in 15ml tubes and digested for 30 min in an Innova 4,430 incubator with agitation at 300 rpm at 37°C, using a digestion solution of 750μg/ml Liberase DL (Roche 05466202001) in PBS supplemented with 20% FBS. The resulting suspension was passed through 70μm and 40μm cells strainers (Falcon). Dissociated cells were spun at 300 rpm for 5 mins and resuspended in 1X cold PBS supplemented with 20% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (twice). The resulting cell suspension was co-stained with 0.5μg/ml of Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA; Sigma F7378) to label live cells, and 1μg/ml of Propidium Iodide (PI; Sigma P4864) to label dead/dying cells, and sorted into eppendorf tubes using the BD Influx™ cell sorter by enriching for FDA+/ PI- cells.The 10X Genomics protocol (“Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v2 User Guide” available from https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v2-chemistry) was followed to create gel in emulsion beads (GEMs) containing single cells, hydrogel beads and reagents for reverse transcription, perform barcoded cDNA synthesis, and produce sequencing libraries from pooled cDNAs.

118,"The leaf vasculature plays a key role in solute translocation. Veins consist of at least seven distinct cell types, with specific roles in transport, metabolism, and signaling. Little is known about the vascular cells in leaves, in particular the phloem parenchyma (PP). PP effluxes sucrose into the apoplasm as a basis for phloem loading; yet PP has only been characterized microscopically. Here, we enriched vascular cells from Arabidopsis leaves to generate a single-cell transcriptome atlas of leaf vasculature. We identified 19 cell clusters, encompassing epidermis, guard cells, hydathodes, mesophyll, and all vascular cell types, and used metabolic pathway analysis to define their roles. Clusters comprising PP cells were enriched for transporters, including SWEET11 and SWEET12 sucrose and UmamiT amino acid efflux carriers. PP development occurs independently from APL, a transcription factor required for phloem differentiation. PP cells have a unique pattern of amino acid metabolism activity distinct from companion cells (CC), explaining differential distribution/metabolism of amino acids in veins. The kinship relation of the vascular clusters is strikingly similar to the vein morphology, except for a clear separation of CC from the other vascular cells including PP. In summary, our scRNA-seq analysis provides a wide range of information into the leaf vasculature and the role and relationship of the leaf cell types. We enriched vascular cells from Arabidopsis leaves to generate a single-cell transcriptome atlas of leaf vasculature.

Briefly, using a microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device (Nanoshift), single cells (100/µl) from the lung cell suspension were co-encapsulated in droplets with barcoded beads (120/µl, purchased from ChemGenes Corporation, Wilmington, MA) at rates of 4000 µl/hr. Droplet emulsions were collected for 15 min/each prior to droplet breakage by perfluorooctanol (Sigma-Aldrich). After breakage, beads were harvested and the hybridized mRNA transcripts reverse transcribed (Maxima RT, Thermo Fisher). Unused primers were removed by the addition of exonuclease I (New England Biolabs), following which beads were washed, counted, and aliquoted for pre-amplification (2000 beads/reaction, equals ~100 cells/reaction) with 12 PCR cycles (primers, chemistry, and cycle conditions identical to those previously described. PCR products were pooled and purified twice by 0.6x clean-up beads (CleanNA).

All participants gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich. For transport from the surgeon to the laboratory, lung tissue samples were stored in ice-cold DMEM-F12 media and packed in thermo stable boxes. Tissue was processed with a maximum delay of 2 h after surgery. On delivery to the lab, tissue samples were assessed visually for qualification for the study. For each sample, 1-1.5 g of tissue was homogenized by mincing with scissors into smaller pieces (~0.5 mm2/piece). Prior to tissue digestion, lung homogenates were cleared from excessive blood by addition of 35 ml of ice-cold PBS, followed by gentle shaking and tissue collection using a 40μm strainer. The bloody filtrate was discarded. The tissue was transferred into 8 ml of enzyme mix consisting of dispase (50 caseinolytic U/ml), collagenase (2 mg/ml), elastase (1 mg/ml), and DNase (30 µg/ml) for mild enzymatic digestion for 1 hour at 37°C while shaking. Enzyme activity was inhibited by adding 5 ml of PBS supplemented with 10% FCS. Dissociated cells in suspension were passed through a 70μm strainer and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes to lyse remaining red blood cells.

121,"We explored how aging impacts transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile hundreds of CD4+ T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological challenge drives a conserved transcriptomic switch from highly variable to tightly regulated gene expression, characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging significantly perturbed the activation of this core program, and increased expression heterogeneity across the population of cells in both species.","cDNAs were made on-chip (Fluidigm C1, 5-10um IFC) with Clontech SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit.

Quality control was performed based on reads mapping to ERCCs and exons, mitochondrial genes, and based on the library size. Additionally, B-cell and CD8+ T cell contaminations were removed as well as insufficiently activated CD4+ T cells. Cells that passed quality control are labeled as high quality and were used for downstream normalisation and analysis. BASiCS was used to normalize raw transcript counts.Naive and effector memory (EM) CD4+ T cells were purified from spleens of both young and old C57/BL6 mice by FACS.  Briefly, spleens were harvested from both young and old animals and single cell suspensions were obtained by meshing through a cell strainer (70 m). B cells were depleted from cell suspensions by MACS using CD19 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-052-201) and red blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend, #B205551).

123,We used single-cell RNAseq to investigate the heterogeneity of glioblastoma tumors and assess differential expression between cells within and in proximity of the tumor. Examination of cell types in human primary glioblastoma samples.,"We analyzed samples from four patients with confirmed cases of primary glioblastoma. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. From each patient, we collected two separate tissue samples: one originating from the tumor core and another from the peritumoral space (cortex) immediately adjacent to the tumor core. The samples were processed similarly to existing protocols for human brain dissection. In brief, the tissue was first chopped into small pieces (less 1 mm3) with a 10 scalpel blade and then incubated in 30 U/mL papain at 34C for 100 min. After digestion, the tissue was washed with a protease inhibitor stock solution. The tissue was then gently triturated in order to yield a single-cell suspension. The single-cell suspension was then added to a series of plastic petri dishes pre-coated with cell-type-specific antibodies (see below) and incubated for 10-30 min at room temperature. Unbound cells were transferred to the subsequent Petri dish, and the dish with bound cells was rinsed eight times with PBS to wash away loosely bound contaminating cell types. The antibodies used included anti-CD45 to capture microglia and macrophages, anti-O4 hybridoma to harvest oligodendrocytes lineage cells, anti-Thy1 (CD90) to harvest neurons, anti-HepaCAM to harvest astrocytes, and Banderiaea simplicifolia lectin 1 (BSL-1) to harvest endothelial cells. Once bound to the Petri dish and rinsed, adherent cells were removed by incubating in a trypsin solution at 37C for 5-10 min before gently squirting the cells off the plate. These single-cell suspensions were then transferred to a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer before proceeding with single cell sorting. Single-cell suspensions were sorted by a SONY SH800 Cell Sorter. All events were gated with four consecutive gates: (1) forward scatter-area (FCS-A)/side scatter-area (SSC-A), (2) FCS-height (FCS-H)/FCS-width (FCS-W), (3) propidium iodide (PI) negative, and (4) Hoechst positive.

Cells were washed and resuspended in 250µl FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 1mM EDTA), targeting the required 1,000 cells/µl concentration, accounting for a 10-20% loss. We pipetted 9.7 µl cell suspension (concentration of 913 cells/µl, ~ 8,800 cells), targeting the recovery of ~ 5,000 cells.Paired-end sequencing with NextSeq 500 (Illumina).The 10x Genomics Chromium scRNA-seq (10x) data was processed using cellranger-2.1.0 and default parameters and the mouse NCBI38/mm10 genome. Molecular counts were obtained for 2,919 cells, with 174,362 mean reads/cell, an average of 60.5% reads mapping to the transcriptome, and 3,404 median detected genes/cell. We filtered outlier cells using the median absolute deviation from the median total library size (log scale) as well as total gene numbers (log scale), as implemented in scran (Lun et al., 2016), and using a cutoff of 3 (isOutlier, nmads=3). The majority of the cells expressed high levels of the housekeeping gene Actb, as well as the ASPC marker genes Cd34, Ly6a, and Itgb1. An initial analysis using all cells revealed that one of the major sources of variation was related to the expression of the gene Xist, as exemplified by the strong clustering of Xist-expression cells in the 2D t-SNE projection. As Xist was expressed (>2 reads/cell) in 93% of the C1 cells, for comparative consistency, we thus only included Xist-expressing cells (>=2 molecular counts/cell) in the reported results, opting to examine sex-specific differences in a separate study. We also noted a strong cell division signal in a small (27) number of cells, as quantified by Cyclone (Scialdone et al., 2015), and exemplified by Mki67 expression. As the C1 data contained cells predicted to be in G1 only (with a single exception), we also excluded the cells predicted to be in G2M and S phase, respectively. Finally, we noticed high epithelial-specific gene expression in a small subset of cells (again, unlike the C1 experiment), we thus excluded all cells showing any (>0) Epcam or Krt19/Krt18 expression. The final reported dataset consists of 1,804 cells.",126
127,"Splenic white pulp (WP) structures are underpinned by fibroblastic stromal cells (FSCs) to facilitate splenic compartmentalization and execute efficient immune responses. Although distinct WP FSCs exhibit various molecular traits, the origin and the hierarchical differentiation of different cell subsets are not characterized. Here we showed, the organization of splenic WP and the differentiation of WP FSCs were governed by lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling pathway. Cell fate mapping analysis revealed that different WP fibroblastic stromal cells descend from a common perivascular LTβR-sensitive mesenchymal lymphoid organizer cells (mLTo) at prenatal stage. Moreover, embryonic mLTo cells required LTβR signaling to give rise to different WP stromal cell subsets, while the proliferation of these cells was devoid of LTβR signaling but followed the development of WP during ontogeny. Moreover, cell fate mapping from different time point indicated a consecutive commitment of mLTo cells initiated from the proximal region around the splenic artery. RNAseq and differentiation trajectory analysis of distinct FSCs showed that Ltbr-deficient cells and perivascular reticular cells (PRCs) from adult spleen exhibited a progenitor phenotype and revealed a closer hierarchical lineage with embryonic mLTo cells. Taken together, our results unveil that embryonic mLTo cells residing in the perivascular niches can give rise to different FSC populations in a LTβR-dependent manner during development.","Preprocessing and gene expression estimation was performed using CellRanger (v2.1.1), generating UMI counts for 1,852 cells and 24,796 genes with a count above zero in at least one cell.

130,"GABAergic interneurons play crucial roles in the regulation of neural circuit activity in the cerebral cortex. A hallmark of cortical interneurons is their remarkable structural and functional diversity, yet the molecular determinants and the precise timing underlying their diversification remain largely unknown. Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to identify distinct types of progenitor cells and newborn neurons in the ganglionic eminences, the embryonic proliferative regions that give rise to cortical interneurons. These embryonic precursors define temporally and spatially restricted transcriptional trajectories that unambiguously relate to specific classes of interneurons in the adult cerebral cortex. Our findings therefore suggest that interneuron diversity is already patent shortly after neurons become postmitotic through the acquisition of specific transcriptional programs that unfold over several weeks in the developing cortex Mouse embryos were isolated at E12.5 and E14.5 from timed pregnant CD1 female mice. The dorsal MGE (dMGE), ventral MGE (vMGE) and caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) regions were dissected. Cells were captured with small-sized (5-10 µm) RNA-seq IFCs using the Fluidigm C1 system. Libraries of single cells pooled from each C1 IFC were denatured and HiSeq flow cell was run for 100 cycles using a single-read recipe.","Both male and female CD1 mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories were used in single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. Mice were housed in groups and kept on reverse light/dark cycle (12/12 h). Time-mated pregnant female mice were housed individually. The day on which the vaginal plug was found was considered as embryonic day (E) 0.5. The date of birth was considered as postnatal day (P) 0. Mouse embryos were isolated at E12.5 and E14.5 from timed pregnant CD1 female mice. Embryos were stored on ice in 1x PBS. Brains were dissected out, embedded in 1% Ultrapure Low Melting Point Agarose and cut in 100 μm thick sections using a vibratome (Leica VT1200S). The dorsal MGE (dMGE), ventral MGE (vMGE) and CGE regions were dissected from these sections.Dissected tissue was then immediately transferred to warm (37C) papain/protease/dispase (PPD) solution in a 15ml conical tube and incubated for 30 min at 37C. Tissue was gently stirred by pipetting every 5 min during the incubation. Once tissue pieces were no longer visible, the suspension was centrifuged at 300g (0.3 RCF) for 3 min. After centrifugation, cells were re-suspended in 1x PBS and filtered through a 40 um cell strainer. Cell concentration was measured using a hemocytometer and adjusted accordingly. Cells were captured with small-sized (5-10 um) RNA-seq IFCs using the Fluidigm C1 system according to the manufacturers instructions. Trypan Blue staining was used immediately before cell captures to assess viability. Cell viability was nearly 100% in all experiments. A concentration of 1,000–3,000 cells/ul was used for cell loading. After capture, C1 chips were examined visually and the number of cells at each capture site was recorded manually.Cells captured by C1 were subsequently processed through lysis, reverse transcription and PCR amplification to generate single-cell cDNA libraries using the Smarter Ultra Low Input RNA kit for Fluidigm (Clontech). cDNAs were harvested the next morning in about 3 ul C1 harvest reagent and were transferred to a 96-cell PCR plate in 10 ul C1 DNA dilution reagent.The resulting cDNA samples were indexed using Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina).

131,"As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic failure such as cancer. Here we describe a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2544 human pancreas cells from donors, spanning six decades of life. We find that islet cells from older donors have increased levels of disorder as measured both by noise in the transcriptome and by the number of cells which display inappropriate hormone expression, revealing a transcriptional instability associated with aging. By analyzing the spectrum of somatic mutations in single cells from previously-healthy donors, we find a specific age-dependent mutational signature characterized by C to A and C to G transversions, indicators of oxidative stress, which is absent in single cells from human brain tissue or in a tumor cell line. Cells carrying a high load of such mutations also express higher levels of stress and senescence markers, including FOS, JUN, and the cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase SOD1, markers previously linked to pancreatic diseases with substantial age-dependent risk, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and adenocarcinoma. Thus, our single-cell approach unveils gene expression changes and somatic mutations acquired in aging human tissue, and identifies molecular pathways induced by these genetic changes that could influence human disease. Also, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA-seq data from primary cells to derive meaningful insights into the genetic processes that operate on aging human tissue and to determine which molecular mechanisms are coordinated with these processes. Examination of single cells from primary human pancreas tissue","All studies involving human pancreas or islets were conducted in accordance with Stanford University Institutional Review Board guidelines, including informed consent for tissue donation from all subjects. De-identified human pancreata or islets were obtained from previously healthy, non-diabetic organ donors with BMI < 30, less than 15 hr of cold ischemia time, and deceased due to acute trauma or anoxia. For FACS, scRNA-seq studies islets from three juvenile (ages 1 month-old, 5, 6 years), and five adult donors (ages 21, 22, 38, 44, 54 years) were used.Isolated human islets were dissociated into single cells by enzymatic digestion using Accumax (Invitrogen). Prior to antibody staining, cells were incubated with blocking solution containing FACS buffer (2% v/v fetal bovine serum in PBS and goat IgG [Jackson Labs], 11.2 ug per million cells). LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Dye (Life Technologies) was used as a viability marker. Cells were then stained with appropriate antibodies at 1:100 (v/v) final concentration. The following antibodies were used for FACS experiments: HPx1-Dylight 488 (Novus, NBP1-18951G), HPi2-Dylight 650 (Novus, NBP1-18946C), CD133/1 - Biotin (Miltenyi Biotec 130-090-664), CD133/2 - Biotin (Miltenyi Biotec 130-090-852), streptavidin-eFluor780 (eBioscience, 47-4317-82), streptavidin-APC (eBioscience, 17-4317-82), anti human EpCAM-APC (Biolegend, 324208). Cells were sorted on a special order 5-laser FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) using a 100 m nozzle following doublet removal. Sorted single cells were collected directly into 96-well plates (Bio-Rad cat HSP9601) containing 4 uL of lysis buffer with dNTPs (Picelli et al., 2014) for downstream single-cell RNA-seq assays. Single-cell RNA-seq libraries were generated as described (Picelli et al., 2014). Single-cells collected in 96-well plates were lysed, followed by reverse transcription with template-switch using an LNA-modified template switch oligo to generate cDNA. After 21 cycles of pre-amplification, DNA was purified and analyzed on an automated Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical). Each cell’s cDNA fragment profile was individually inspected and only wells with successful amplification products (concentration higher than 0.06 ng/ul) and with no detectable RNA degradation were selected for final library preparation. Tagmentation assays and barcoded sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera XT kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturers instructions.Barcoded libraries were pooled and subjected to 75 bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq instrument.Sequencing reads were trimmed, adapter sequences removed and the reads aligned using STAR with default parameters.

132,"CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to play a protective role in several viral infections. However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, heterogeneity and clonal diversity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4+ memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA-seq in over 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile and clonality in humans. The single-cell differential gene expression analysis, revealed a spectrum of known transcripts, including several linked to cytotoxic and co-stimulatory function, and transcripts of unknown cytotoxicity-related function that are expressed at higher levels in the TEMRA subset, which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs, compared to cells in the central and effector memory subsets (TCM, TEM). Simultaneous T cells antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single-cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-TEMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared to TCM and TEM cells and that the majority of CD4-TEMRA were dengue virus (DENV)-specific in subjects with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRA was highly heterogeneous across subjects, with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. Most importantly, we identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and thus could provide insights into the mechanisms that may be utilized to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.

133,"In this study, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to gain unprecedented insight into the phenotypic heterogeneity and the transcriptional dynamics of microglia cells during the progression of neurodegeneration. Briefly, by using a severe neurodegeneration mouse model with Alzheimer’s-like pathology and phenotypes (CK-p25 model), we surveyed microglia activation by RNA sequencing longitudinally at fine temporal- and single-cell resolution. In summary, our work identified previously unobserved heterogeneity in the response of microglia to neurodegeneration, discovered novel microglia cell states, revealed the trajectory of cellular reprogramming of microglia in response to neurodegeneration, and uncovered the underlying transcriptional programs. These insights into the molecular programs underlying microglia activation provided by our study may pave the way for designing new rational and efficient strategies to treat Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. To determine the phenotypic heterogeneity and the transcriptional dynamics of microglia cells during the progression of neurodegeneration, we used the CK-p25 mouse model of severe neurodegeneration which develops AD-like pathology in an inducible and temporally predictable manner. We isolated cells expressing the microglia markers CD11b and CD45 from the hippocampus of three to four CK-p25 animals and three CK control littermates at each of the following four time points during the progression of neurodegeneration: before p25 induction (0 weeks), 1 week, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after p25 induction. Single microglial cells (expressing the cell surface markers CD11b and CD45) were sorted directly into RNA lysis buffer in 96-well plates using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). We prepared a total of 2183 single-cell RNA-sequencing libraries using a modified version of the Smart-Seq2 protocol and sequenced the libraries to a depth of 251353 (median) mapped reads per cell.","Adult (3 months old) male double transgenic CK-p25 mice and their CK control littermates were used for the experiments. Mice were housed in groups of three to five on a standard 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, and all experiments were performed during the light cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. The hippocampus was rapidly dissected and placed in ice cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS). The tissue was then enzymatically digested using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotec, catalogue number 130-092-628) according to the manufacturers protocol, with minor modifications. The resulting cell suspension was then stained using allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated CD11b mouse clone M1/70.15.11.5 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-098-088) and phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated CD45 antibody (BD Pharmingen, 553081) according to the manufacturer’s (Miltenyi Biotec) recommendations.FACS was then used to purify CD11b and CD45 positive microglial cells. Standard, strict side scatter width versus area and forward scatter width versus area criteria were used to discriminate doublets and gate only singlets. Viable cells were identified by staining with propidium iodide (PI) and gating only PI-negative cells.

134,"Anopheline mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium parasites to humans, and are responsible for an estimated 219 million cases of malaria, leading to over 400,000 deaths annually. The mosquito’s immune system limits Plasmodium infection in several ways, and hemocytes, the insect white blood cells, are key players in these defense responses. However, the full functional diversity of mosquito hemocytes and their developmental trajectories have not been established.  We use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptional profiles of individual mosquito hemocytes in response to blood feeding or infection with Plasmodium. Circulating hemocytes were collected from adult A. gambiae M form (A. coluzzii) females that were either kept on a sugar meal or fed on a healthy or a Plasmodium berghei-infected mouse. Transcriptomes from 5,383 cells (collected 1, 3, and 7 days after feeding) revealed nine major cell clusters.","For Anopheles gambiae: Hemocytes were collected by gradually injecting in the thorax of cold-anesthetized mosquitoes 10 uL of anti-coagulant media (2 uL at a time) composed of 60% Schneider’s insect media, 30% citrate buffer, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, final pH 7.0-7.4, sterilized through a 0.22 um syringe filter. Fire-polished and thin-wall single barrel TW150-6 borosilicate glass capillaries 152 mm long with 1.5 / 1.12 OD / ID in mm were prepared with a Narishige PC-10 needle puller (heater N.2 mode, heat level 24.8). The tip of the needle was carefully cut open with fine tweezers and a gentle incision made in the lower abdomen with sterile micro-forceps (2). We built an oil-free anti-coagulant buffer injection system composed of a Tritech Research microINJECTOR system with a microinjector All-Digital Multi-pressure system (MINJ-D) controller, a precision N2 cylinder pressure regulator for gas pressure control (TREG-N2) fitted with BS341 cylinder fittings for use in the United Kingdom (TREG-BR580), and a brass straight-arm needle holder (MINJ-4). The regulator was set at 20 psi. Hemolymph was collected as above with a steady pressure of 1 psi during injection until 10 uL were collected per mosquito from the lower abdomen into non-stick Eppendorf tubes to prevent cell attachment. Cells were counted manually by placing 8-12 mosquito hemocytes in sterile single-use disposable hemocytometer slides (Neubauer Improved, iNCYTO C-Chip DHC-N01) under a light microscope with a 40X objective.  When preparing cells for scRNA-seq, hemocytes were treated with the biomolecule stabiliser and cell fixative vivoPHIX (RNAssist Ltd, Cambridge, UK). vivoPHIX protects RNA, DNA and proteins from degradation within fixed cell, was developed from a deep eutectic solvent, is non-cross-linking, dissolves fat droplets, and has very low volatility, so that fixed cells can be stored for weeks at room-temperature and months at 4°C prior to analysis by scRNA-seq. When fixing hemocytes with vivoPHIX cells were collected as above and then plunged into 500 uL of fixative at room temperature. After processing four mosquitoes the cell-fixative was mixed well by pipetting 5 times with a P1000. The procedure was repeated after adding four more samples, or reaching required amounts (8-12 mosquitoes per condition). Hemocytes were then fixed for 2 hours at room temperature, before being transferred to 4°C storage. On the day of processing, fixed hemocytes were mixed with one volume of pure, molecular grade ethanol before centrifugation for 30 minutes at 3k RCF at room temperature. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in pure molecular grade water before 10X Chromium scRNA-seq library processing. After having prepared an appropriate single cell suspension, 10X Genomics Chromium droplet single-cell RNAseq master mix was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the V2 3’ Chromium 10X single cell kit (custom 14 PCR amplification cycles). For scRNA-seq Chromium 10X V2 and V3 kits, HS4000 (using kit version 1) 10X V2 and V3 read lengths: libraries were run on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument with standard protocols using a 150-cycle kit set. As recommended by 10x Genomics an elongated reverse read was used during the sequencing run.  For V2, the read lengths were as follows: Read 1: 26 bases, index 1: 8 bases, read 2: 98 bases. For V3, read lengths were as follows: Read 1: 28 bases, index 1: 8 bases, read 2: 91 bases. Libraries supplied at 2.8 nM and loaded at a concentration of 280 pM.Three different challenges were used to generate A. aegypti samples. Three to four days old females were either fed with serum, bacteria or injected with dsRNA for a bacterial gene (LacZ) and non-related to the mosquito genome. Mosquitoes were injected with dsLacZ two days prior to serum feeding. For the bacterial feeding we used a mixture of cultivable bacteria from our colony at NIH as described before (23). Briefly, on the day of the experiment, a pre-inoculum was diluted in fresh LB and grown for 2 hours at 28oC. The culture was washed with PBS to remove toxins and the concentration was estimated by measuring the optical density (OD) at 600nm. We considered 1OD the equivalent of 109 bacteria/ml. Non-injected females were fed with either serum or 4x109 bacteria mixed with serum. dsLacZ-injected females were fed only with serum. Four days post feeding, twenty-five mosquitoes were perfused per replicate and three replicates were done per experimental group (control serum fed, bacteria fed and dsRNA-injected serum fed). Hemolymph (10 µl/ mosquito) was placed directly in 0.5 ml of vivoPHIX for stabilization. After 60 um filtering three volumes of glacial acetic acid were added to one volume of fixed hemocyte and mixed well. After 10 minutes incubation samples were transferred to ice. Then, one volume of pure molecular grade ethanol was added to the mixture and mixed well before centrifugation for 20 minutes at 3k RCF at room temperature. Supernatant was discarded and pellet resuspended in pure molecular grade water with 0.1% BSA, freshly-prepared, before staining and sorting. A Sony SH800 sorter was used to sort vivoPHIX fixed hemocytes stained for 20 minutes with 1 drop per 500 ul of sample of NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent (Hoechst 33342 formulation by ThermoFisher). The sorter was operated with 100 um disposable chips. Cells were sorted on fluorescence intensity, with 405 nm laser excitation and Hoechst 33342 filter, gated to exclude negative events using a non-stained control. Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) information was also used to exclude doublets and multiples. Cells were sorted into chilled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes before scRNA-seq V2 3’ Chromium 10X library preparation.",134
135,"Single-cell whole transcriptome analysis of chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells, defined as Lin-CD34+CD38-. We developed a method that combines high-sensitivity mutation detection with whole-transcriptome analysis of the same single cell. We applied this technique to analyze more than 2,000 single cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) throughout the disease course, revealing heterogeneity of CML stem cells, including the identification of a subgroup of CML stem cells with a distinct molecular signature that selectively persisted during prolonged therapy. We performed differential gene expression and the gene set enrichment analyses of BCR-ABL+ vs BCR-ABL- single cells from either patients or normal donors, analyzed at different stages of the disease.","Bone marrow mononuclear cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients or normal donors were isolated using Ficoll density gradient.Single cells were isolated by FACS sorting as Lin-CD34+CD38-From single FACS sorted cells, cDNA was generated according to Smart-seq2 protocol Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed in 96-well plates using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit.RNA-Seq:Short reads (51-bp) were aligned to the human genome (GRCh37 assembly (hg19)) using Tophat with a supplied set of known RefSeq transcripts as the input.

For all experiments, young mice were between 8-12 weeks of age and aged mice were between 20-24 months of age.Where applicable, treated HSCs were grown in HSPC media with 100ng/ml LPS (SIGMA CAT: L2880-100MG), and 1ug/ml Pam3csk4 (Invivogen CAT: 41-11-60-10) for two hoursTissues were first harvested and cells were homogenized. Samples were depleted of RBCs using RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend). Cells were subsequently stained with fluorescently labeled antibody. Respective cell types were analyzed according to relevant surface markers by using the following antibodies: CD45.1 and CD45.2, lineage-specific markers (CD11b, Gr-1, CD19, B220, CD3e, Nk1.1 and Ter119), or progenitorspecific markers (CD150, CD48, Flt3, CD34, FcRgamma and IL7R). All antibodies were purchased from BioLegend. HSPCs were sorted by first lineage-depleting whole bone marrow from young and aged mice. Samples were incubated with biotin-conjugated lineage antibodies (CD19, B220, CD4, CD8, CD11b, Gr-1, Ter119, Nk1.1, IL7Ra each at 1:200 dilution), and passaged through Miltenyi MACS negative selection columns. Cells were subsequently analyzed with a MACSQuant10 Flow Cytometry machine (Miltenyi), or sorted using BD Aria sorter. HSPCs were sorted using SLAM markers with the following gating strategies: for MPPs: Lineage-cKit+Sca1+CD150-CD48+, for ST-HSCs: Lineage-cKit+Sca1+CD150-CD48- and for LTHSCs: Lineage-cKit+Sca1+CD150+CD48-. Single cell and 100 cell populations were lysed by sorting into 5ul TCL Buffer (QIAGEN) with 1% 2-Mercaptoethanol, centrifuged and frozen at -80C. Smart-seq2 protocol was carried out as previously described (Picelli et al., 2013) with minor modifications. cDNA was amplified with 20 cycles and tagmented with a quarter of the standard Illumina NexteraXT reaction volume.Single-cell libraries were pooled and paired-end sequenced (38bp x 2) on an Illumina Hiseq2500 or Nextseq500.",136

138,"The purpose of this single cell experiment is to compare and characterize at molecular level actively cycling stem cells in the isthmus and quiescent stem cells in the base of the mouse stomach corpus. The lineage tracing data from Stmn1-CreERT2 shows that Stmn1+ cells in the corpus isthmus include fast dividing isthmus stem cells with long-term potency. On the other hand, chief cells including Lgr5+ subpopulation can play as quiescent stem cells in the base that are largely quiescent in homeostasis, but are activated upon injury. The isthmus stem cells and chief cells are isolated by Stmn1 and Pgc, respectively, and were subject to single cell RNA-seq experiment.","The mouse stomach corpus was dissected and the tissue was dissociated into single-cell suspension by the incubation with Dispase ‖ (45U.ml). Then the single cells were sorted into 384 well plates containing lysis buffer by BD INFLUX. Spike-in RNA from the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) (Ambion, Life Technologies) was added to each well in 1:640,000 dilution. Stomach cell sorting was performed by the WT Sanger Institute Flow Cytometry Facility for single cell RNA-seq data generation. Stomachs were prepared by carefully separating the corpus from the forestomach and pylorus. Corpus tissue was divided into 4 pieces of similar size and incubated in 4 mL dissociation solution (45 U/mL Dispase II, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 0.6 mg/mL Pancreatin, Sigma; 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin in DMEM high glucose, HEPES, no phenol red, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C with shaking at 270 rpm. After dissociation the solution becomes cloudy and corpus fragments appear more transparent. All subsequent steps were then performed on ice. To avoid cell loss due to cell adhesion to pipette or tube walls, all pipettes and tubes used for pipetting the cell suspension were pre-incubated with either DMEM or PBS containing FBS. To further disrupt the tissue, the cell suspension, including corpus pieces, was pipetted up and down several times using a 10 mL pipette. The cell suspension without remaining corpus pieces was then transferred to a 15 mL Falcon tube. The corpus pieces and the dissociation tube were then washed twice with 5 mL DMEM + 10% FBS and the wash solutions combined with the cell suspension for inactivation of the dissociation reaction. Cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and resuspended in 1% FBS in PBS. The cell suspension was filtered through a 100 µm cell strainer into a pre-coated 15 ml tube. The tube and filters were washed twice with 1 mL of 1% FBS in PBS and the cell suspension was then centrifuged a second time at 300 g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µL of antibody mix (1% FBS; 10 U/mL DNAse, Promega; 1:125 Alexa Fluor® 647-conjugated anti-mouse/human CD324 (E-Cadherin) antibody, BioLegend) and incubated for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed with 3 mL 1% FBS in PBS and filtered once more if clumps could be observed. After centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL 1% FBS and 10 U/mL DNAse in PBS for sorting. BD INFLUX systems were used for sorting in the WT Sanger Institute Flow Cytometry Facility. After the viable cells were gated at first, the cell were subject to the second gating to select only singlet cells. Then the third gating was to select E-Cadherin+ epithelial cells by Alexa 647. The fourth gating was performed to select Stmn1+ cells by eGFP or Pgc+ cells by dsRed depending of the target cells we want to isolate in different single cell data generation.Each well of the 384 well plate contained 2.3 ul of lysis buffer with RNAse inhibitor (Ambion) in a 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution.Preamplification was performed in a total volume of 27 ul that contained 13.5 ul of HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (2x; KAPA Biosystems) and 0.1 uM of IS PCR primer (Sigma-Aldrich). After 25 cycles of amplification, samples were cleaned with 80% (v/v) of Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter). Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina).  Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in rapid run to obtain 100 bp paired-end reads. Paired-end reads of Stmn+ single cells were mapped to the Mus musculus genome (GRCm38) using STAR (v2.5.2b) with default parameters. Splice junctions in reads were detected with the help of a GTF file of GRCm38 provided by Ensembl (release 90). Uniquely mapped reads were counted for each gene using htseq-count (v0.7.2). We removed poor-quality cells that have greater than 10% reads mapped to mitochondrial-encoded genes and greater than 97% genes expressed below a detection limit of 5 read counts.",138

140,"Current gene-expression databases for the haematopoietic system provide information on gene expression profiles present in bulk populations. Although informative, these studies lack the resolution that can be gained at a single-cell level. In particular, population-average data assumes homogeneity within the population and may as such obscure the ability to detect the heterogeneity of decision-making processes in individual cells. Here we report 1656 single cell transcriptomes analysed by single-cell RNA sequencing. Cells were FACS sorted on broad gates encompassing haematopoietic stem and progenitor populations (HSPCs), with index sorting data collected to permit retrospective identification of populations by surface marker expression. Our dataset thus represents the gene expression landscape of HSPCs at single-cell resolution, capturing the heterogeneity in and between cell populations. Pseudotime analysis visualized haematopoietic stem (HSC) to progenitor transitions, identified HSC as well as lineage-specific transcriptional programs, and also highlighted putative lineage branching points. To provide access to the wider scientific community, a user-friendly website was developed with intuitive search and display functionality. Single cell RNA sequencing of haematopoeitic stem and progenitor cells","Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs, tibiae and iliac crest of 20 8-12 week old C57BL/6 female mice. The cells were lineage depleted and stained with antibodies to separate individual populations by FACS. Single-cell sorting was done using a FACS Influx5 (BD Biosciences) using unstained cells and single-stained cells are gate-setting controls. Cells were sorted directly into individual wells of a 96-well PCR plate containing lysis buffer. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis was performed as described previously (Picelli et al., 2014).

141,"How a neuronal cell type is defined and how this relates to its transcriptome are still open questions. The Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) are among the bestcharacterized neuronal types: Different PN classes target dendrites to distinct olfactory glomeruli and PNs of the same class exhibit indistinguishable anatomical and physiological properties. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomes of 40 PN classes and unequivocally identified transcriptomes for 6 classes. We found a new lineage-specific transcription factor that instructs PN dendrite targeting. Transcriptomes of closely-related PN classes exhibit the largest difference during circuit assembly, but become indistinguishable in adults, suggesting that neuronal subtype diversity peaks during development. Genes encoding transcription factors and cell-surface molecules are the most differentially expressed, indicating their central roles in specifying neuronal identity. Finally, we show that PNs use highly redundant combinatorial molecular codes to distinguish subtypes, enabling robust specification of cell identity and circuit assembly. Single-cell RNA-seq","In all experiments, both male and female flies were used. The following fly lines were used in this study: Mz19-GAL4 (BL#34497) (Jefferis et al., 2004), C15-RNAi (line1, BL#27649), C15-RNAi (line2, BL#35018), Alrm-GAL4 (BL# 67032).

Single labeled cells were sorted via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) into individual wells of 96-well plates containing lysis buffer using an SH800 instrument (Sony Biotechnology)Sequencing libraries were prepared following the smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al, 2014) with several modifications. To increase cDNA yield and detection efficiency, we increased the number of PCR cycles to 25. To reduce the amount of primer dimer PCR artifacts, we digested the reverse-transcribed first-strand cDNA using lambda exonuclease (New England Biolabs) (37°C for 30 min) prior to PCR amplification.Sequencing was performed using Illumina Nextseq 500 platform with paired-end 75 bp reads",141
142,"Nervous systems are composed of numerous cell types, but the extent of cell type diversity is poorly understood. Here, we construct a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice based on single cell RNA-sequencing. We sectioned fresh brains from adult transgenic male mice, microdissected the full cortical depth, combinations of sequential layers or individual layers (L1, 2/3, 4, 5 and 6) of primary visual cortex (VISp), and generated single-cell suspensions. To access both abundant and rare cell types in VISp, we selected a set of transgenic mouse lines in which Cre recombinase is expressed in specific subsets of cortical cells. Each Cre line was crossed to the Ai14 Cre reporter line, which expresses the fluorescent protein tdTomato (tdT) after Cre-mediated recombination. To label more specific cell populations, we combined Cre lines with Dre or Flp recombinase lines and intersectional reporter lines (Ai65 or Ai66). We identify 49 transcriptomic cell types including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. Single-cell RNA-Seq of adult mouse primary visual cortex","Animals were provided food and water ad libitum and were maintained at a regular 12 h day/night cycle at no more than 5 adult animals per cage. Animals were maintained on the C57BL/6J background.Individual adult male mice (P56±3) were anesthetized in an isoflurane chamber, decapitated, and the brain was immediately removed and submerged in fresh ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The brain was sectioned on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S) on ice, and each slice (300-400 µm) was immediately transferred to an ACSF bath at room temperature. After the brain slicing is complete (not more than 15 minutes), individual slices of interest were transferred to a small Petri dish containing bubbled room temperature ACSF. The regions of interest (all layers of VISp or specific layers of VISp) were microdissected under a fluorescence dissecting microscope, and the slices before and after dissection were imaged to later examine the location of the microdissected tissue and confirm its location within V1. The dissected tissue pieces were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and treated with 1 mg/ml pronase in carbogen-bubbled ACSF for 70 minutes at room temperature without mixing in a closed tube. After incubation, with the tissue pieces sitting at the bottom of the tube, the pronase solution was pipetted out of the tube and exchanged with cold ACSF containing 1% fetal bovine serum. The tissue pieces were dissociated into single cells by gentle trituration through Pasteur pipettes with polished tips of 600, 300, and 150-µm diameter. Single cells were isolated by FACS into individual wells of 96-well plates or 8-well PCR strips containing 2.275 µl of Dilution Buffer (SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit for Illumina Sequencing, Clontech Cat#634936), 0.125 µl RNase inhibitor (SMARTer kit), and 0.1 µl of 1:1,000,000 diluted RNA spike-in RNAs (ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix 1, Life Technologies Cat#4456740). Sorting was performed on a BD FACSAriaII SORP using a 130um nozzle, a sheath pressure of 10psi, and in the single cell sorting mode. To exclude dead cells, DAPI (DAPI 2HCl, Life Technologies Cat#D1306) was added to the single cell suspension to the final concentration of 2 ng/ml. FACS populations were chosen to select cells with low DAPI and high tdTomato (tdT) fluorescence. In some cases, we also selected cells that have low DAPI and low tdT fluorescence, in order to capture tdT-negative cells from a sample. To collect all cells in an unbiased manner, we selected all cells with low DAPI fluorescence, regardless of their tdT fluorescence level. Sorted cells were frozen immediately on dry ice and stored at -80°C. We used the SMARTer kit from Clontech (SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit for Illumina Sequencing, Clontech Cat#634936) to reverse transcribe single cell RNA, and amplify the cDNA for 19 PCR cycles. To stabilize the RNA after quickly thawing the cells on ice, we immediately added to each sample an additional 0.125 µl of RNase inhibitor mixed with SMART CDS Primer II A. All steps downstream were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each amplification experiment included a set of controls: 10 pg cortex RNA (isolated from Rbp4-Cre;Ai14, P57 male) as positive control for amplification, ERCC-only control to demonstrate the absence of RNases throughout the sorting process, and water-only control, to control for specificity of amplification/absence of contamination. cDNA concentration was quantified using Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chips. For most samples, 1 ng of amplified cDNA was used as input to make sequencing libraries with Nextera XT DNA kit (Illumina Cat#FC-131-1096). For smaller cells (e.g., glia), which did not consistently produce more than 1ng cDNA, we used 0.5–1 ng cDNA as input. We stopped the procedure after PCR clean-up and did not perform library normalization or library pooling. Individual libraries were quantified using Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 7500 chips. In order to assess sample quality and adjust the concentrations of libraries for multiplexing on HiSeq, all libraries were sequenced first on Illumina MiSeq to obtain approximately 100,000 reads per library, and then on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 to generate 100 bp reads.",142
143,"Diverse cell types are produced from dorsal and ventral regions of the developing neural tube. In this study we describe a system for generating human inhibitory interneurons by ventralizing human embryonic stem cells in vitro and characterizing the gene expression of the cell types produced over time. We engineered a DCX-Citrine/Y hESC line to sort and characterize progenitor and neuron transcriptomics separately at both the subpopulation and single cell level. The cells generated in vitro were compared to similar populations present in human fetal brain samples by mapping gene expression data from human fetal cells onto the principal component analysis (PCA) space of in vitro-derived populations. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to determine the discreet cell types present at D24, D54, D100 and D125 of culture, and describe the gene expression changes that occur in progenitor and neuron populations over time. Immature lateral ganglionic eminence and medial ganglionic eminence cells are present at early timepoints, along with MGE-like and dorsal pallium-like neuronal progenitors. At later timepoints we observe the emergence of SST-expressing interneurons, as well as oligodendrocyte and astrocyte progenitors. We also identified genes that were upregulated in somatostatin-expressing interneurons as they mature. The transcriptomes of 1732 ventralized single cells were profiled by SmartSeq2 at different timepoints throughout a 125-day differentiation protocol that converted H1 human embryonic stem cells to a variety of ventrally-derived cell types.","We constructed an hESC line with Citrine (Cit) fused to the endogenous copy of the DCX gene in the H1 parent line (WAe001-A RRID:CVCL_9771) to allow us to profile neurons (Cit+) and progenitors (Cit−) (Yao et al., 2017). hESCs were seeded for a 10-day cortical induction phase in NIMX media with SMAD inhibitors; reseeded for the ventralization phase at D10 in culture media containing Shh and purmorphamine, and finally at D24 for neural differentiation with neurogenic/neurotrophic factors BDNF, GDNF, NT3, and cAMP. The protocol was ended at D125.To generate single cell suspensions, hESC-derived cultures were dissociated from plates using Accutase (ThermoFisher) at 37C. Light trituration using a P1000 pipette was done every 5 min until nearly all clumps had been dissociated (up to 1 h). Cell suspension was washed and filtered through a 40 um cell strainer. Cells were washed in PBS with 1% FBS and stained with 0.5-1 ug/mL DAPI. Single-cell suspensions were loaded onto a FACSAria II SORP (Becton Dickinson) and sorted directly into PCR strip tubes or plates held in chilled aluminium blocks. Doublets and dead cells were excluded based on forward scatter, side scatter and DAPI fluorescence. Sorting was done using the 130 um nozzle with the sort mode set to single cell. Accuracy of single-cell sorts was confirmed by sorting DAPI-stained fixed cells onto a dry well of a 96-well plate and analyzing by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were prepared for single-cell transcriptomics using SmartSeq2 (Picelli et al., 2014). After reverse transcription and template switching, we amplified cDNA with KAPA HotStart HIFI 2× ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems) for 22 cycles for RNA from single primary cortical cells. We purified PCR products using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). We quantified cDNA using a High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent) on a Bioanalyzer 2100 or with the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher) on an Enspire plate reader (PerkinElmer). We used 1 ng of cDNA to generate RNA-Seq libraries using the Nextera XT library prep system (Illumina). We carried out sequencing of human cortical cells the on Illumina HiSeq using 50 base paired-end readsRead were aligned transcriptome by RSEM to RefSeq gene annotation (April 23, 2013), and unmapped reads were aligned to genome by Bowtie.

144,"Pancreatic islet cells are critical for maintaining normal blood glucose levels and their malfunction underlies diabetes development and progression. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of 1,492 human pancreatic alpha-, beta-, delta- and PP cells from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes organ donors. We identified cell type specific genes and pathways as well as 245 genes with disturbed expression in type 2 diabetes. Importantly, 92% of the genes have not previously been associated with islet cell function or growth. Comparison of gene profiles in mouse and human α- and β-cells revealed species-specific expression. All data are available for online browsing and download and will hopefully serve as a resource for the islet research community. Single-cell RNA sequencing of human non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic pancreatic islet cells","Normal and diabetic human islets isolated from cadaveric pancreas were obtained from Prodo Laboratories, Inc. All organ donors provided informed consent for use of human islets for research. Since all islets were from de-identified deceased donors, this study was exempt from the institutional review board. Human islets and relevant donor information including age, gender, ethnicity, diabetes status, and BMI were obtained from Prodo Labs. The donor’s diabetes status was defined by the patient’s medical record and, when available, the hemoglobin A1c. Islets were handpicked and enzymatically digested at 37C for 10 min using TrypLE Express (Life Technologies). Dissociated cells were filtered through a 30-um strainer and recovered by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in fresh PIM(S) complete media (Prodo Labs). Trypan blue staining revealed 85% +/- 9% (n = 18) cell viability. Single islet cells in PIM(S) complete media (300–500 cells/uL) were mixed (3:2 ratio) with C1 Cell Suspension Reagent (Fluidigm) before loading onto a 10–17 um diameter C1 Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC; Fluidigm). LIVE/DEAD staining solution was prepared by adding 2.5 uL ethidium homodimer-1 and 0.625 uL calcein AM (Life Technologies) to 1.25 mL C1 cell wash buffer (Fluidigm), and 20 uL was loaded onto the C1 IFC. Each capture site was carefully examined under a Nikon microscope in bright field, GFP, and Texas Red channels for cell doublets.Cell lysing, reverse transcription, and cDNA amplification were performed on the C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep IFC, as specified by the manufacturer (Protocol 100-7168 E1). The SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit (Clontech) was used for cDNA synthesis from the single cells. Illumina NGS library was constructed with Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Protocol 100-7168 E1). Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina) rapid mode by multiplexed single-read run with 50 cycles.Illumina Casava 1.8.2 software used for basecalling.

145,"To understand the diversity of cellular states within mouse intestinal epithelial tissue, we obtained whole intestines from wild type mice, disaggregated the samples, sorted into single cells and profiled them by single-cell RNA-seq. To understand normal tissue homeostasis, untreated cells were profiled, while to investigate the impact of enteric pathogens on epithelial cells, mice infected with both Salmonella enterica and the parasitic worm H. polygyrus were profiled using both 3'-droplet-based and full length plate-based single-cell RNAseq. RANKL-mediated differentiation of organoid cultures were used to sequence the rare intestinal M cell, these were then compared to M cells obtained from the in vivo follicle associated epithelium (FAE). NOTE: This dataset represents a subset of the original GSE92332 containing only 1,522 epithelial cells sequenced using full-length plate-based single cell RNA-seq.","For all experiments, mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups after matching for the sex and age of 7-10 week-old female or male wild-type C57BL/6J or Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreER-T2 (Lgr5-GFP) mice, obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour). The small intestine of C57BL/6J wild-type or Lgr5-mice was isolated and rinsed in cold PBS. The tissue was opened longitudinally and sliced into small fragments roughly 2 mm in length. The tissue was incubated in 20 mM EDTA-PBS on ice for 90 min, shaking every 30 min. The tissue was then shaken vigorously and the supernatant was collected as fraction 1 in a new conical tube. The tissue was incubated in fresh EDTA-PBS and a new fraction was collected every 30 min. Fractions were collected until the supernatant consisted almost entirely of crypts. The final fraction (enriched for crypts) was washed twice in PBS, centrifuged at 300g for 3 min, and dissociated with TrypLE express (Invitrogen) for 1 min at 37C. The single-cell suspension was then passed through a 40 um filter and stained for FACS for scRNA-seq.For plate-based full-length scRNA-seq experiments, a FACS machine (Astrios) was used to sort a single cell into each well of a 96-well PCR plate containing 5 ul of TCL buffer with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol.

147,"The liver parenchyma is composed of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells (BECs). Controversy exists regarding the cellular origin of human liver parenchymal tissue generation during embryonic development, homeostasis or repair. Here we report the existence of a hepatobiliary hybrid progenitor (HHyP) population in human fetal liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. HHyPs are anatomically restricted to the ductal plate of fetal liver and maintain a unique transcriptional profile distinct from fetal hepatocytes, mature hepatocytes and mature BECs.  In addition, molecular heterogenicity within the EpCAM+ population of freshly isolated fetal and adult human liver reveals diverse gene expression signatures of hepatic and biliary lineage potential. Finally, we FACS isolated fetal HHyPs and confirmed their hybrid progenitor phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that hepatobiliary progenitor cells previously identified in mice also exist in humans, and can be distinguished from other parenchymal populations, including mature BECs, by distinct gene expression profiles.

152,"Ageing of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment is characterized by skewing towards the myeloid lineage and reduced stem cell function, the molecular basis of which is largely unknown. Using single cell approaches we identify features contributing to HSC exhaustion with age. A distinct subpopulation of old HSCs carried a signature indicative of impaired stem cell function, activating p53 targets involved in senescence. In the same HSCs, we identified pro-proliferative JAK/STAT and MAPK signalling. We hypothesized that prolonged proliferation of HSCs leads to cell cycle arrest with age and therefore challenged HSCs with a constant proliferative stimulus mediated by a constitutively active form of Jak2, Jak2V617F. Indeed we observed expansion of the p53 positive population and functional impairment of the challenged HSCs. Our results reveal unexpected heterogeneity in the rate of HSC ageing and strongly implicate a role for proliferation in the p53 mediated functional decline of old HSCs. 192 single HSCs from 2 young WT or Jak2V617F and 2 old WT or Jak2V617F animals were used for comparison","hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from whole bone marrow using ESLAM markers foir FACS sorting The libraries were constructed according to Picelli et al 2014 using Nextera Illumina KitIllumina basecalling Reads mapped to Mouse GRC38-77 reference genome from ENSEMBL plus ERCC92 spike-in controls with tophat 2.0.13 and bowtie 2.2.3 Gene expression count matrix was calculated with htseq-count Genome_build: GRC38 release 77 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Tabular separated raw counts.

153,"The identification of cell types and marker genes is critical for dissecting neural development and function, but the size and complexity of the brain has hindered the comprehensive discovery of cell types. We combined single-cell RNA-seq with anatomical brain registration to create a comprehensive map of the zebrafish habenula, a conserved forebrain hub involved in pain processing and learning. Single-cell transcriptomes of ~13000 habenular cells (>4x coverage) identified 18 neuronal types and dozens of marker genes. Registration of marker genes onto a common reference atlas created a rich resource for anatomical and functional studies and enabled the mapping of active neurons onto neuronal types following aversive stimuli. Strikingly, despite brain growth and functional maturation, cell types were retained between the larval and adult habenula. This study provides a gene expression atlas to dissect habenular development and function and offers a general framework for the comprehensive characterization of other brain regions. gng8-GFP zebrafish heads were dissected, dissociated and FAC sorted into 96 well plates.

154,"Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage-tracing, temporal single cell analyses and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged uni-lineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: Some progenitors specify lineages immediately; others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.

165,"Cerebral organoids – three-dimensional cultures of human cerebral tissue derived from pluripotent stem cells – have emerged as models of human cortical development. However, the extent to which in vitro organoid systems recapitulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation programs observed in vivo remains unclear. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect and compare cell composition and progenitor-to-neuron lineage relationships in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. Covariation network analysis using the fetal neocortex data reveals known and novel interactions among genes central to neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In the organoid, we detect diverse progenitors and differentiated cell types of neuronal and mesenchymal lineages, and identify cells that derived from regions resembling the fetal neocortex. We find that these organoid cortical cells use gene expression programs remarkably similar to those of the fetal tissue in order to organize into cerebral cortex-like regions. Our comparison of in vivo and in vitro cortical single cell transcriptomes illuminates the genetic features underlying human cortical development that can be studied in organoid cultures. 734 single-cell transcriptomes from human fetal neocortex or human cerebral organoids from multiple time points were analyzed in this study. All single cell samples were processed on the microfluidic Fluidigm C1 platform and contain 92 external RNA spike-ins. Fetal neocortex data were generated at 12 weeks post conception (chip 1: 81 cells; chip 2: 83 cells) and 13 weeks post conception (62 cells). Cerebral organoid data were generated from dissociated whole organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cell line 409B2 (iPSC 409B2) at 33 days (40 cells), 35 days (68 cells), 37 days (71 cells), 41 days (74 cells), and 65 days (80 cells) after the start of embryoid body culture. Cerebral organoid data were also generated from microdissected cortical-like regions from H9 embryonic stem cell derived organoids at 53 days (region 1, 48 cells; region 2, 48 cells) or from iPSC 409B2 organoids at 58 days (region 3, 43 cells; region 4, 36 cells).","freeIbis was used as an efficient basecaller with calibrated quality scores for Illumina sequencers.

167,"Many patients with advanced cancers achieve dramatic responses to a panoply of therapeutics, yet retain minimal residual disease (MRD), which ultimately results in relapse. To gain insights into the biology of MRD we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to malignant cells isolated from BRAF-mutant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) melanoma cohorts exposed to concurrent BRAF/MEK-inhibition. We performed single cell RNA and single cell DNA sequencing from a PDX melanoma model before and on treatment (BRAF&MEK inhibitors). Furthermore, we performed bulk RNAseq of in vitro cultures that were derived from our PDX model, which were treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors and FACS sorted for GFRA2high and low cells. NOTE: This dataset represents a subset of the original GSE116237 containing only 674 cells sequenced using full-length plate-based single cell RNA-seq.","Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models were established using tissue from patients undergoing surgery as part of standard-of-care melanoma treatment at the University Hospitals KU Leuven. PDX model MEL006 was derived from a female. Fresh tumor tissue was collected in transport medium (RPMI1640 medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and amphotericin B). Tumor fragments were subsequently rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and amphotericin B and cut into small pieces of approximately 3 x 3 x 3 mm3. Tumor pieces were implanted subcutaneously in the interscapular fat pad of female SCID-beige mice (Taconic). Sedation and analgesia was performed using ketamine, medetomidine and buprenorphine. After reaching generation 4 (F4), one mouse with a tumor of 1000 mm3 was sacrificed. This tumor was minced followed by dissociation using collagenase I and IV and trypsin. Cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium and 250 000 cells were injected in the interscapular fat pad of 8 - 16 week old female NMRI nude mice (Taconic). For single cell RNA sequencing purposes, cells were transduced with a lentivirus carrying dsRed. Cells were washed four times before injecting into the interscapular fat pad.Mice with tumors reaching 1000 mm3 were started on the BRAF-MEK combination via daily oral gavage. BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 30 and 0.3 mg/mL respectively, aliquoted and stored at -80C. Each day a fresh aliquot was thawed and diluted 1:10 with phosphate-buffered saline. Mice were treated with a capped dose of 600 - 6 ug dabrafenib – trametinib respectively in 200 ul total volume.Cells were incubated with GFRA2 antibody AF429 for 45 minutes at room temperature, followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in FACS sorting buffer (culture medium supplied with 5% serum and 2 mM EDTA). FACS analyses were performed with BD FACSAria III and FlowJo software. SYTOX Blue negative, dsRed positive single cells were sorted (BD FACSAria III) in 96 well plates (VWR, DNase, RNase free) containing 2 ul of lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 4U of RNase inhibitor, Takara) per well. Plates were properly sealed and spun down at 2000 g for 1 min before storing at -80C.Whole transcriptome amplification was performed with a modified SMART-seq2 protocol as described previously (Picelli et al., 2014), using 20 instead of 18 cycles of cDNA amplification. PCR purification was realized with a 0.8:1 ratio (ampureXP beads:DNA). Amplified cDNA quality was monitored with a high sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent) using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent).Sequencing libraries were performed using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) as described previously (Picelli et al., 2014), using 1/4 of the recommended reagent volumes and 1/5 of input DNA with a tagmentation time of 9 min.

168,"We report transcriptomes from 430 single glioblastoma cells isolated from 5 individual tumors and 102 single cells from gliomasphere cells lines generated using SMART-seq. In addition, we report population RNA-seq from the five tumors as well as RNA-seq from cell lines derived from 3 tumors (MGH26, MGH28, MGH31) cultured under serum free (GSC) and differentiated (DGC) conditions. This dataset highlights intratumoral heterogeneity with regards to the expression of de novo derived transcriptional modules and established subtype classifiers. Operative specimens from five glioblastoma patients (MGH26, MGH28, MGH29, MGH30, MGH31) were acutely dissociated, depleted for CD45+ inflammatory cells and then sorted as single cells (576 samples). Population controls for each tumor were isolated by sorting 2000-10000 cells and processed in parallel (5 population control samples). Single cells from two established cell lines, GBM6 and GBM8, were also sorted as single cells (192 samples).  SMART-seq protocol was implemented to generate single cell full length transcriptomes (modified from Shalek, et al Nature 2013) and sequenced using 25 bp paired end reads. Single cell cDNA libraries for MGH30 were resequenced using 100 bp paired end reads to allow for isoform and splice junction reconstruction (96 samples, annotated MGH30L). Cells were also cultured in serum free conditions to generate gliomasphere cell lines for MGH26, MGH28, and MGH31 (GSC) which were then differentiated using 10% serum (DGC). Population RNA-seq was performed on these samples (3 GSC, 3 DGC, 6 total). The initial dataset included 875 RNA-seq libraries (576 single glioblastoma cells, 96 resequenced MGH30L, 192 single gliomasphere cells, 5 tumor population controls, 6 population libraries from GSC and DGC samples). Data was processed as described below using RSEM for quantification of gene expression. 5,948 genes with the highest composite expression either across all single cells combined (average log2(TPM)>4.5) or within a single tumor (average log2(TPM)>6 in at least one tumor) were included. Cells expressing less than 2,000 of these 5,948 genes were excluded.

169,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are increasingly appreciated as important participants in homeostasis and inflammation. Substantial plasticity and heterogeneity among ILC populations have been reported. Here we have delineated the heterogeneity of human ILCs through single-cell RNA sequencing of several hundreds of individual tonsil CD127+ ILCs and natural killer (NK) cells. Unbiased transcriptional clustering revealed four distinct populations, corresponding to ILC1 cells, ILC2 cells, ILC3 cells and NK cells, with their respective transcriptomes recapitulating known as well as unknown transcriptional profiles. The single-cell resolution additionally divulged three transcriptionally and functionally diverse subpopulations of ILC3 cells. Our systematic comparison of single-cell transcriptional variation within and between ILC populations provides new insight into ILC biology during homeostasis, with additional implications for dysregulation of the immune system.","Tonsils were received fresh from adult patients (age 20–65 years) or pediatric patients (age 2–7 years) given tonsillectomy due to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

173,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons provide an opportunity to model Parkinson’s disease (PD) but neuronal cultures are confounded by cellular heterogeneity. By applying high-resolution single cell transcriptomic analyses to Parkinson’s iPSC-derived dopamine neurons carrying the GBA-N370S risk variant, we exploited intra-culture cellular heterogeneity to identify a progressive axis of gene expression variation leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Analysis of genes differentially-expressed (DE) along this axis identified the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) as an upstream regulator of disease progression. HDAC4 was mislocalized to the nucleus in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons and repressed genes early in the disease axis, leading to late deficits in protein homeostasis. Treatment of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons with compounds known to modulate HDAC4 activity upregulated genes early in the DE axis, and corrected Parkinson’s-related cellular phenotypes. Our study demonstrates how single cell transcriptomics can exploit cellular heterogeneity to reveal disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.","Purification of iPSC derived dopaminergic neurons was carried out as previously described (Sandor et al., 2017).

Libraries were multiplexed at 24–48 libraries per lane and 51-bp single-end reads were sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 2500 system). Remaining cells were processed for bulk RNA-seq as previously described [13, 14] (also Supporting Information Methods).A BAC clone (CTD-3013L6) with the complete CRX coding region was obtained (CalTech Human BAC Library D, Life Technologies) and red-ET recombination was used to introduce the tdTomato gene (Clontech) and a PGK/gb promoter driving a neomycin resistance gene upstream of the start codon in exon 2 of CRX. A 29-kb BamHI fragment containing the modified CRX gene was then subcloned into the hES-2A-inducible BAC vector. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs, WA09 line, WiCell) were harvested for transfection 2 days post-passaging and resuspended in OptiMEM (Life Technologies) at 5 × 106 cells/mL. 500 μl of cells was added to a cuvette containing 30 μg of linearized CRX reporter construct and 10 μg mRNA encoding a pair of zinc finger proteins (5 μg each) specific to CRX (Sigma) in 300 μl PBS. Cells were electroporated (320V, 200 μF) and plated. Geneticin (100 μg/mL) was added until single drug-resistant colonies formed. Genomic DNA was extracted from drug resistant colonies and analyzed by qPCR using primers specific to the endogenous CRX locus or to both the endogenous and transgenic CRX sequences. Clones with one copy of endogenous CRX relative to an internal control were identified as targeted. G-banding analysis (WiCell) was performed to confirm karyotype. The CRX+/tdTomato line was then grown in mTeSR (WiCell) on matrigel-coated plates and differentiated to OVs using established protocols [1]. Characterization was performed with ICC and RT-PCR as previously described [11], as well as with high content imaging analysis (Supporting Information Methods; Supporting Information Table 1 and 2 for antibodies and RT-PCR primers). A subset of PRs were recorded via standard whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology (Supporting Information Methods). Human prenatal and adult eye tissue collection: Human prenatal eyes (122 days gestation) were obtained from the Laboratory of Developmental Biology (University of Washington-Seattle). Tissue collection methods adhered to IRB requirements, NIH guidelines, and the Helsinki Declaration. Adult human eyes (64 years old) were acquired from the Lions Eye Bank of Wisconsin.",174
175,"We performed single cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for 549 primary breast cancer cells and lymph node metastases from 11 patients with distinct molecular subtypes (BC01-BC02, estrogen receptor positive (ER+); BC03, double positive (ER+ and HER2+); BC03LN, lymph node metastasis of BC03; BC04-BC06, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+); BC07-BC11, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); BC07LN, lymph node metastasis of BC07) and matched bulk tumors. We separated these single cells into epithelial tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cells using inferred CNVs from RNA-seq. The refined single cell profiles for the tumor and immune cells provide key expression signatures of breast cancer and the surrounding microenvironment. All single-cell mRNA expression profiles were acquired from eleven patients (BC01-BC11) including two lymph node metastases (BC03LN, BC07LN) (549 samples). We applied four filtering criteria so as to remove samples with low sequencing quality and finally obtained 515 single cell sequencing data. Matched bulk tumor tissues and/or pooled cells were also sequenced and analyzed by the single cell RNA-seq pipeline (14 samples). Bulk tumor transcriptomes showed significant correlations with the average of single cell transcriptomes.","A total of 10 of 11 patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma underwent breast-conserving surgery or total mastectomy without prior treatment. Patient BC05 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Herceptin, and was thus excluded from subtype-specific analyses. In all, 11 primary tumour specimens (BC01–BC11) and 2 metastatic lymph nodes (BC03LN and BC07LN) were collected and processed for single-cell RNA sequencing. For BC09, two runs of single-cell RNA sequencing were performed and combined for downstream analysis. On the day of surgery, all single cells were dissociated with mechanical and enzymatical method then immediately used for assay without any in vitro culture.Single-cell suspensions of breast cancer tissues or lymph node metastases were obtained by mechanical dissociation and enzymatic digestion on the day of the surgery. Dead cells were removed by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (17-1440-02, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) separation, and 50,000 cells were loaded onto an individual 10–17 um integrated fluidic circuit mRNA sequencing chip in the C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System (100-5760, Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA). Loaded chips were microscopically examined to verify single-cell loading. cDNA synthesis and amplification were performed with SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit (Clontech) in the C1TM Single-Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm). RNA spike-ins 1, 4 and 7 from ArrayControl TM RNA Spikes (ThermoFisher) were added to the lysis mix for validation of array and batch effect. Amplified cDNAs were quantified and qualified by the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).Starting with 0.375 ng of amplified cDNAs, sequencing libraries were constructed with the Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). All of constructed libraries were quantified and qualified by the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) then pooled without index overlapping. Finally pooled libraries were sequenced using the HiSeq2500 (Illumina) as 100-bp paired-end mode of the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster kit and TruSeq Rapid SBS kit.A modified reference was generated by merging the three array control RNA spike-ins (ThermoFisher) and the human genome reference (hg19) with the GENCODE 19 annotations. Paired-end 100bp reads were aligned to the modified reference by 2-pass mode of STAR_2.4.0b with default parameters.

176,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal interstitial lung disease causing alveolar remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis.  We utilized single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify epithelial cell types and associated biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF.  Transcriptomic analysis of epithelial cells from normal human lung defined gene expression patterns associated with highly differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, indicated by enrichment of RNAs critical for surfactant homeostasis.  In contrast, scRNA-seq of IPF cells identified three distinct subsets of epithelial cell types with characteristics of conducting airway basal and goblet cells and, an additional atypical “transitional”; cell that contribute to pathological processes in IPF.  Individual IPF cells frequently co-expressed alveolar AT1, AT2, and conducting airway selective markers, demonstrating “indeterminate”; states of differentiation not seen in normal lung development.  Pathway analysis predicted aberrant activation of canonical signaling via TGF-b, HIPPO/YAP, P53, and AKT-PI3 Kinase.  Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy identified the disruption of alveolar structure and loss of the normal proximal-peripheral differentiation of pulmonary epithelial cells.  Single cell transcriptomic analyses of respiratory epithelial cells identified loss of normal epithelial cell identities and unique contributions of epithelial cells to the pathogenesis of IPF.  Present scRNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of normal and IPF respiratory epithelial cells provides a rich data source to further explore lung health and disease. Examination of expression profiling at single-cell level between IPF and Control.","Deidentified lung tissue samples were obtained from Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Duke University Medical Center, or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. IPF tissues (n = 6) were collected from lung explants of IPF patients undergoing lung transplantation, and lung lobes from adult donors that were resected on the basis of size incompatibility or that were deemed unsuitable for transplant were utilized as control tissues (n = 3) for cell sorting by FACSPeripheral human lung tissue with airways no larger than 2 mm in diameter and lacking visceral pleura was mechanically minced and enzymatically dissociated to generate a single-cell suspension.Dissociated single-cell preparations from peripheral lung of IPF patients (n = 6) and controls (n = 3) were enriched for AT2 epithelial cells by FACS for CD326 (CD326) double positive, CD45 (hematopoietic) negative, CD31 (endothelial) negative cells, and HTII-280 after dissociation by proteases. Cells were plated overnight and sorted. After sorting, cells were preserved in either RNAprotect Cell (QIAGEN) or RNAlater RNA stabilization (QIAGEN) reagent. For single cell analysis cell capture, lysis, reverse transcription and cDNA amplification were performed on the C1 IFC for mRNA-seq on Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System following the manufacturer's protocol. Medium sized C1 mRNA-Seq chips were used to capture each cell-cycle fraction. The C1 Auto-prep system captures the dissociated single cells across 96 wells and performs cell lysis, cDNA synthesis with reverse transcription and PCR reaction using the SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit v3 (ClonTech, Mountain View, CA). Cells captured across the 96 wells are manually inspected as a quality control measure to remove empty well, doublets or debris containing wells. cDNA from several representative cells are checked by High Sensitivity DNA chips using Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical) and all cDNA libraries are quantitated via Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA).Libraries for each of the 96 captured cells are prepared using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit with 96 dual barcoded indicesBriefly, the analytic pipeline consisted of four components that included: gene pre-filtering and normalization, reiterative cell type mapping (hierarchical clustering followed by PCA), cell specific signature genes identification, and driving forces prediction for each cell type. Detailed methods and code for this analytic pipeline are found in “SINCERA: A pipeline for single-cell RNA-Seq profiling analysis.” (3) and are available on line at https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/sincera.html as an open access program.

177,"Neural crest cells migrate throughout the embryo, but how cells move in a directed and collective manner has remained unclear. Here, we perform the first single-cell transcriptome analysis of cranial neural crest cell migration at three progressive stages in chick and identify and establish hierarchical relationships between cell position and time-specific transcriptional signatures. We determine a novel transcriptional signature of the most invasive neural crest Trailblazer cells that is consistent during migration and enriched for approximately 900 genes. Knockdown of several Trailblazer genes shows significant but modest changes to total distance migrated. However, in vivo expression analysis by RNAscope and immunohistochemistry reveals some salt and pepper patterns that include strong individual Trailblazer gene expression in cells within other subregions of the migratory stream. These data provide new insights into the molecular diversity and dynamics within a neural crest cell migratory stream that underlie complex directed and collective cell behaviors. 501 single cells analyzed from various parts of the migrating neural crest during various timepoints in development. 96 cells from HH11 Trailblazers, 50 cells from HH13 Trailblazers, 50 cells from HH13 Leaders, 60 cells from HH13 Trailers, 50 each from HH15 Trailblazers, Leaders, and Trailers. For definitions, see the extract protocol. Neural crest from a neural tube placed in culture were also analyzed.","Cells were isolated by FACS, which included forward scatter, side scatter, pulse width, live/dead stain and YFP gates. Cells were sorted directly into 6 ul of Clontech lysis solution containing 0.05% RNAse inhibitor. Following lysis for 5 min at room temperature, lysates were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80C. Single-cell lysates were thawed on ice. cDNA synthesis and library preparation were performed with SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA-seq (634892, Takara, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) and Nextera XT DNA dual indexing library preparation kits as recommended by the manufacturer (FC-131–1096, Illumina). Despite more cost-effective scRNAseq strategies, SMARTseq v4 was employed in order to detect the greatest number of genes per single cell, which is critical for distinguishing highly similar cell subpopulations (Ziegenhain et al., 2017; Dueck et al., 2016).Fertilized, white leghorn chicken eggs (NCBI Taxonomy ID:9031; Centurion Poultry Inc., Lexington, GA, USA) were incubated in a humidified chamber at 38C to the developmental desired stage. For NC cell isolations, pre-migratory NC were labeled by electroporation of a Gap43-YFP plasmid DNA into the dorsal neural tube of HHSt9 embryos as previously described (McLennan and Kulesa, 2007) and re-incubated (8, 16 and 24 hr for HHSt11, 13 and 15, respectively). After re-incubation, embryos were harvested into chilled 0.1% DEPC PBS and screened for health and transfection efficiency before tissue isolations were performed. For additional information, please see methods in PMID: 29199959 DOI: 10.7554/eLife.28415Fastq files were generated with bcl2fastq2 (2.18.0.12).

NT were incubated for 24 hr to allow NC to emerge from the NT and migrate onto the substrate. NT were then gently removed with a tungsten needle, so that only migratory NC remained. Media was gently removed and the adherent cells rinsed once with 0.1% DEPC PBS before trypsinization (25200–056, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 5 min at 37C and trypsin inactivation with fetal bovine serum. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in chilled 0.1% DEPC PBS. For NC cell isolations, pre-migratory NC were labeled by electroporation of a Gap43-YFP plasmid DNA into the dorsal neural tube of HHSt9 embryos as previously described (McLennan and Kulesa, 2007) and re-incubated (8, 16 and 24 hr for HHSt11, 13 and 15, respectively). After re-incubation, embryos were harvested into chilled 0.1% DEPC PBS and screened for health and transfection efficiency before tissue isolations were performed. For scRNA-seq, the NC r4 stream was isolated by manual dissection at HHSt11, 13 and 15. HHSt11 r4 streams containing few migrating NC were pooled. For HHSt13 and 15 embryos, the r4 NC stream was further subdivided by manual dissection into three spatially distinct, non-overlapping portions: the most invasive front (5% of the stream, termed ‘Front’), the leading portion of the stream (25% of stream proximal of the most invasive front, termed ‘Lead’) and the proximal-most trailing portion of the stream (70% of the stream, termed ‘Trail’).

178,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing is revolutionising our understanding of seemingly homogeneous cell populations but has not yet been widely applied to single-celled organisms. Transcriptional variation in unicellular malaria parasites from the Plasmodium genus is associated with critical phenotypes including red blood cell invasion and immune evasion, yet transcriptional variation at an individual parasite level has not been examined in depth. Here, we describe the adaptation of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol to deconvolute transcriptional variation for more than 500 individual parasites of both rodent and human malaria comprising asexual and sexual life-cycle stages. We uncover previously hidden discrete transcriptional signatures during the pathogenic part of the life cycle, suggesting that expression over development is not as continuous as commonly thought. In transmission stages, we find novel, sex-specific roles for differential expression of contingency gene families that are usually associated with immune evasion and pathogenesis.","The original Smart-seq2 protocol with the Superscript II enzyme and the original oligo(dT) with an anchoring base was run with 30 PCR cycles of preamplification on 10 samples. The samples included a single no-cell control, five single P. falciparum gametocytes, two 10-cell controls and two 100-cell controls. These were multiplexed, along with three samples each of individual human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and sequenced on a single MiSeq run with 150bp paired end reads. To test the effect of different reverse transcriptase enzymes and different numbers of PCR cycles, we sequenced P. falciparum schizont libraries prepared using 1) the SmartScribe enzyme (Clontech) for a) six single cells, one 100-cell control and two no-cell controls with 25 cycles of PCR, and b) six single cells and one 100-cell control with 30 cycles of PCR; and 2) the SuperScript II enzyme (Thermofisher) for a) six single cells, one 100-cell control and two no-cell controls with 25 cycles of PCR, and b) six single cells and one 100-cell control with 30 cycles of PCR. These were multiplexed on a single MiSeq run with 150bp paired end reads. To determine whether single-cell samples might be contaminated with either additional cells or RNA from lysed cells, individual mCherry P. berghei (RMgm-928 25) and GFP P. falciparum 27 schizonts were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, inactivated with RNALater fixation and then sorted. A multiplex library was prepared comprising 32 single P. berghei schizonts, two 100-cell P. berghei schizont controls, one no cell control, 40 single P. falciparum schizonts and two 100-cell P. falciparum schizont controls. These libraries were sequenced as a multiplex pool on a single MiSeq run with 150bp paired end reads. The P. berghei mixed blood stage samples comprised 182 single-cells of P. berghei, plus four no-cell controls and six 100-cell controls. These were multiplexed with another 192 samples not analysed in this work and sequenced on a single HiSeq 2500 lane using HiSeq v4 with 75bp paired end reads. The P. falciparum gametocyte samples were sequenced as three multiplexed pools of 84, using the same chemistry. Three technical duplicate samples were excluded from analysis. The P. falciparum asexual samples were sequenced as two pools of 96, each on one Illumina HiSeq 2500 lane using HiSeq v4 chemistry with 75bp paired-end reads. Each batch of 96 samples contained three 100-cell controls. The second batch (lane 7) contained six samples of stage I gametocytes and six samples of stage II gametocytes, each with a single 100-cell control. These were not included in the analysis, leaving 176 single cell samples.Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer recommendations. 96 or 384 different index combinations were used to allow multiplexing during sequencing. After indexing, libraries were pooled for clean-up at a 4:5 ratio of Agencourt Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter). Quality of the libraries was monitored with the high sensitivity DNA chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. Empty-well controls and single cells were pooled separately from 100 cell controls and loaded proportionally to their expected cell content for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq or HISeq 2500.Isolation of P. berghei parasites: The constitutively mCherry-expressing P. berghei ANKA line, clone RMgm-928, was propagated in a female 6- to 8-week-old Theiler’s original outbred mouse supplied by Envigo UK. (RMgm-928 clone modified by introduction of two mCherry-expression cassettes (pL1694 and pL1695) into the GIMOpbANKA. Construct pL1694 contains the hsp70 promoter (5’hsp70)-mCherry-3’hsp70 cassette and construct pL1695 the b9 promoter-mCherry-3’b9 cassette. These constructs are integrated into the modified P. berghei 230p locus containing the hdhfr::yfcu selectable marker cassette by double cross-over homologous recombination at the target regions). Parasites were purified from an overnight (20h) 50 mL culture of 1 mL of infected blood using a 55% Histodenz cushion (SIGMA), following an established schizont purification protocol detailed elsewhere. Purified late stages (asexual and sexual) were pelleted at 450g for 3 minutes and incubated with 500 µL of RNALater (ThermoFisher) for 5 minutes, and further diluted into 3 mL of 1x PBS prior to cell sorting.

Isolation of P. falciparum: 3D7-HTGFP, a GFP-expressing P. falciparum strain 27, was maintained in O-negative red blood cells obtained from the NHSBT, using RPMI 1640 culture medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (SIGMA), 10mM D-Glucose (SIGMA), 50 mg/L hypoxanthine (SIGMA), 10% human serum (obtained locally in accordance with ethically approved protocols), and gassed using a mix containing 5% O2 , 5% CO2 and 90% N2. Parasites were highly synchronised using two consecutive cycles of Percoll-Sorbitol treatment. Late asexual parasites (trophozoites and schizonts) were purified on a cushion of 63% Percoll (GE Healthcare). Stage V gametocytes were obtained using standard gametocyte culturing 29 and purified magnetically with an LS column 30 (Miltenyi Biotec). Following purification of each stage, all P. falciparum parasites were pelleted at 800g for 5 minutes, incubated with 500 µL of RNALater (ThermoFisher) for 5 minutes, and further diluted into 3 mL of 1x PBS prior to cell sorting.

179,"We sequenced allele-resolution single-cell transcriptomes from mouse primary fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells with the overall aim to infer transcriptional kinetics for each gene and allele. Inferred transcriptional burst kinetics revealed the genomic encoding of transcriptional burst frequencies and sizes within the genome. Core promoter elements were found to specify burst sizes, whereas burst frequencies were regulated by enhancers. In particular burst frequencies were found to account for cell-type differences in gene expression levels and were also mostly correlating with absolute expression levels in cells. Importantly, the patterns identified were not detectable at the level of mean expression demonstrating the need to investigate transcriptional dynamics at the level of burst kinetics.","Primary fibroblasts were derived from adult CAST/EiJ x C57/Bl6 mice.

181,"To understand the diversity of cellular states within mouse intestinal epithelial tissue, we obtained whole intestines from wild type mice, disaggregated the samples, sorted into single cells and profiled them by single-cell RNA-seq. To understand normal tissue homeostasis, untreated cells were profiled, while to investigate the impact of enteric pathogens on epithelial cells, mice infected with both Salmonella enterica and the parasitic worm H. polygyrus were profiled using both 3'-droplet-based and full length plate-based single-cell RNAseq. RANKL-mediated differentiation of organoid cultures were used to sequence the rare intestinal M cell, these were then compared to M cells obtained from the in vivo follicle associated epithelium (FAE). NOTE: This dataset represents a subset of the original GSE92332 containing only 389 epithelial cells sequenced using full-length plate-based single cell RNA-seq in response to Salmonella enterica and to the parasitic helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus.","For all experiments, mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups after matching for the sex and age of 7-10 week-old female or male wild-type C57BL/6J or Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreER-T2 (Lgr5-GFP) mice, obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour). The small intestine of C57BL/6J wild-type or Lgr5-mice was isolated and rinsed in cold PBS. The tissue was opened longitudinally and sliced into small fragments roughly 2 mm in length. The tissue was incubated in 20 mM EDTA-PBS on ice for 90 min, shaking every 30 min. The tissue was then shaken vigorously and the supernatant was collected as fraction 1 in a new conical tube. The tissue was incubated in fresh EDTA-PBS and a new fraction was collected every 30 min. Fractions were collected until the supernatant consisted almost entirely of crypts. The final fraction (enriched for crypts) was washed twice in PBS, centrifuged at 300g for 3 min, and dissociated with TrypLE express (Invitrogen) for 1 min at 37C.

For EpCAM+ isolation, cells were stained for 7AAD- (Life Technologies), CD45- (eBioscience), CD31- (eBioscience), TER-119- (eBioscience), EpCAM+ (eBioscience); for specific epithelial cells, we also stained for CD24+/- (eBioscience) and c-Kit+/- (eBioscience). To enrich for specific intestinal epithelial cell populations, cells were isolated from Lgr5–GFP mice, stained with the antibodies mentioned above and gated on GFP-high (stem cells), GFP-low (TAs), GFP-/CD24+/c-Kit+/- (secretory lineages) or GFP-/CD24-/EpCAM+ (epithelial cells).Libraries were prepared using a modified SMART-Seq2 protocol. In brief, RNA lysate clean-up was performed using RNAClean XP beads (Agencourt) followed by reverse transcription with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) and whole-transcription amplification (WTA) with KAPA HotStart HIFI 2 ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems) for 21 cycles. WTA products were purified with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) and assessed with a high-sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent).RNA-seq libraries were constructed from purified WTA products using Nextera XT DNA Library Preperation Kit (Illumina).

182,"Despite effective treatment, HIV can persist in latent reservoirs, which represent a major obstacle towards HIV eradication. Targeting and reactivating latent cells is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of HIV infected cells. Here, we used a primary model of HIV latency and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity during HIV latency and reactivation. Our analysis identified transcriptional programs leading to successful reactivation of HIV expression. We further validated our results using primary CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV+ individuals. Human primary CD4+ T-cells were infected, cultured, and maintained in a resting, latent phenotype in order to generate a primary model of HIV latency. Latently infected cells were either left untreated, or exposed to SAHA or TCR stimulation, followed by single-cell isolation and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis. Bulk RNA-Seq experiments were also performed as control. To validate the observed cellular heterogeneity in the primary model of HIV latency, we used primary CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV+ individuals. As for the primary HIV latency model, resting cells from HIV+ individuals were either not treated or TCR-treated before single cell isolation and single-cell RNA-Seq.","For the latency model, CD4+ T cells were purified from the buffy coat of uninfected donors by Ficoll gradient separation followed by negative selection and magnetic separation using the human CD4+ T Cell enrichment kit (Stem Cell Technologies 17952). Then the cells were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in Activation Medium (Immunocult XF T cell expansion medium (Stem Cell Technologies 10981) supplemented with 100 U/ml IL-2 (RD 202-IL) and 25 ul/ml of ImmunoCult Human CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (Stem Cell Technologies 10971)). Three days post-TCR activation, cells (2 mio) were transduced with 1.2x105 TU of HIVGFP/VSV-G in presence of 5 ug/ml polybrene by spinoculation (3h, 1500g, 25C). Cells were then washed with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (R-10) and resuspended in 4 ml Expansion Medium (Immunocult XF T cell expansion medium supplemented with 100 U/ml IL-2). After three days, cells were washed, resuspended in RPMI without phenol red and sorted by FACS based on GFP expression. Infected GFP+ cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml Activation Medium and then maintained in Expansion Medium at 106 cells/ml for 2.5 weeks. Cells were stimulated once again in Activation Medium and maintained in Expansion Medium for further 2.5 weeks. Cells were then allowed to revert to a resting phenotype by long-term culture in Latency Medium (50% R-10/50% H80 feeder cell supernatant supplemented with 40 U/ml IL-2) for 8 weeks. In parallel, blood was collected from two HIV-infected individuals participating in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (http://www.shcs.ch), that were on antiretroviral therapy for more than 3 years, with undetectable viremia and a CD4 cell count above 300 for more than one year. Blood (~25 ml) was directly collected in 4 CPT tubes (BD Vacutainer CPT; BD Biosciences 362753) and processed for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolation according to manufacturers instructions. Resting CD4+ T cells were purified by negative selection and magnetic separation using the human CD4+ T Cell enrichment kit supplemented with anti-HLA-DR, anti-CD25 and anti-CD69 (Stem Cell Technologies 19052/17962), and resuspended in R-10 (0.45 um filtered).For the latency model, 2 million cells were, either left untreated, or incubated with 0.5 uM SAHA for 24h, or exposed to anti-CD3/CD28/IL-2 for TCR stimulation for 48h. Cells were then washed and collected for single-cell RNA-Seq. For the cells from donors, the cell samples were either left untreated (control cells) or were activated by T-Cell Receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation for 48 hours in a 48-well plate.Cells were resuspended at 0.5-1 x 106 cells/mL in R-10 (0.45 um filtered) and processed for single-cell isolation on the Fluidigm C1 IFC plate (5–10 um).

187,"We describe a so far uncharacterized, embryonic and self-renewing Neural Plate Border Stem Cell (NBSC) population with the capacity to differentiate into central nervous and neural crest lineages. NBSCs can be obtained by neural transcription factor-mediated reprogramming (BRN2, SOX2, KLF4 and ZIC3) of human adult dermal fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (induced Neural Plate Border Stem Cells, iNBSCs) or by directed differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (NBSCs). Moreover, human (i)NBSCs share molecular and functional features with an endogenous NBSC population isolated from neural folds of E8.5 mouse embryos. Upon differentiation, iNBSCs give rise to either (1) radial glia-type stem cells, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, motoneurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes or (2) cells from the neural crest lineage. Here we provide single cell RNA-sequencing data of six iNBSC lines (310 cells total). iNBSCs were single-cell-sorted and RNA sequencing was performed following the Smart-seq2 protocol.

189,"Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells toward definitive endoderm (DE) is the critical first step for generating cells comprising organs such as the gut, liver, pancreas and lung. This in-vitro differentiation process generates a heterogeneous population with a proportion of cells failing to differentiate properly and maintaining expression of pluripotency factors such as Oct4. RNA-sequencing of single cells collected at four time points during a 4-day DE differentiation identified high expression of metallothionein genes in the residual Oct4-positive cells that failed to differentiate to DE. Using X-ray fluorescence microscopy and multi-isotope mass spectrometry, we discovered that high intracellular zinc level corresponds with persistent Oct4 expression and failure to differentiate. We further show that differentiation-arrested phenotype is inversely correlated with zinc concentration in the differentiation media.

Single-cell libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Smart-seq2 protocol.","Live FLK1+ cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a BD Influx sorter into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing lysis buffer (0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2 U/μl RNase inhibitor (Clontech) and stored at −80 °C (1 plate per tissue was prepared).Timed-matings were set up between C57BL/6 mice, purchased from Charles River. Upon dissection, only embryos staged as Theiler Stage 12 according to Downs and Davies morphological criteria were further processed. Allantois, yolk sac and embryo proper were dissected and placed into separate tubes. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by incubating the embryos with TrypLE Express dissociation reagent (Life Technologies) at 37 °C for 7 min and quenching with heat inactivated serum. Single cells were subsequently stained with Flk1-PE antibody (1:100; Biolegend) and DAPI as viability stain (1µg/ml; Sigma).

We chose adult mice about 3 months old and analysed single cells in the brain. We chose a methodology based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into 384-well plates followed by the SmartSeq2 methodology.","We used transgenic mouse reporter line (SM22-Cre;Rosa26-stop-tdTomato). We chose to focus our efforts to adult mice 12 to 15 weeks old in order to primarily define fully differentiated and quiescent vascular cells. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation, after which the brain was surgically removed. For all brain single-cell isolations, the entire brain, without olfactory bulbs, was used.FACS was used to enrich and capture the cells of interest. Single cells, positive for TdTomato were sorted straight into 2.3 ul lysis buffer pre-dispensed into a 384-well plate.Single-cell libraries were prepared as described by Picelli et al, with the following specifications: 0.0025 ul of a 1:40,000 diluted ERCC spike-in concentration stock was used, and all cDNA was amplified with 22 PCR cycles before QC control with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Biosystems). The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 at the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI), Science for Life Laboratory, Sweden, with single 50-bp reads (dual indexing reads). All single-cell transcriptome data were generated at the Eukaryotic Single-cell Genomics facility at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden.RNA-seq reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using STAR (version STAR_2.4.2a) and the count matrix shows the individual counts aligning to each gene per cell.

194,"Background Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are a heterogeneous population that participates in wound healing, immune modulation and tissue regeneration. Next generation sequencing was used to analyze transcripts from single BMSCs in order to better characterize BMSC subpopulations. Methods Cryopreserved passage 2 BMSCs from one healthy subject were cultured through passage 10. The transcriptomes of bulk BMSCs from designated passages were analyzed with microarrays and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). For some passages, single BMSCs were separated using microfluidics and their transcriptomes were analyzed by RNA-Seq. Results Transcriptome analysis microarray and RNA-Seq of unseparated BMSCs from passages 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 yielded similar results; both data sets grouped passages 4 and 6 and passages 9 and 10 together and genes differentially expressed among these early and late passage BMSCs were similar. 3D Diffusion map visualization of single BMSCs from passages 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 clustered passage 3 and 9 into two distinct groups, but there was considerable overlap for passage 4, 6 and 8 cells. Markers for early passage, FGFR2, and late passage BMSCs, PLAT, were able to identify three subpopulations within passage 3 BMSCs; one that expressed high levels of FGFR2 and low levels of PLAT; one that expressed low levels of FGFR2 and high levels of PLAT and one that expressed intermediate levels of FGFR2 and low levels of PLAT. Conclusions Single BMSCs can be separated by microfluidics and their transcriptome analyzed by next generation sequencing. Single cell analysis of early passage BMSCs identified a subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of FGFR2 that might include skeletal stem cells. Cryopreserved passage 2 BMSCs from one healthy subject were cultured through passage 10. The transcriptomes of bulk BMSCs from designated passages were analyzed with microarrays and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). For some passages, single BMSCs were separated using microfluidics and their transcriptomes were analyzed by RNA-Seq.","One vial of frozen Passage 2 BMSCs was thawed and plated in T75 flasks following the SOP. During the serial culture, cells were seeded at 5000 cells per cm2 and harvested at 70-80% confluence. From passage 3 to 8, cells were passaged after 5 days of culture, and culture media was changed on day 3; from passage 9 to 10, the cells were passaged after 8 days of culture, and culture media was changed on day 3 and 6. Cells from each passage were cryopreserved in a solution containing 90% FBS and 10% DMSO for further studies.BCL files generated by Illumina NextSeq were converted to standard FASTQ files following Illumina’s protocol (basespace.illumina.com).

After the donor was registered an abbreviated physical exam was repeated and another blood sample was collected for TTD testing and ABO grouping as previously reported. The donor was then taken to a hospital procedure room. First, the risks of bone marrow aspiration were reviewed and a surgical consent was signed by each donor. As required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), a ""time out"" was taken to verify donor identity and donor understanding of the procedure to be performed. Bone marrow aspirates were collected according to the standard procedure in use at the NIH Clinical Center; the protocol allows for bilateral collection, but to date unilateral aspirates only have been collected. A 1 mL aliquot of bone marrow at each collection was evaluated by a hematopathology medical technologist in the Department of Laboratory Medicine for the presence of bone spicules as a measurement of aspirate quality; a marrow smear and peripheral blood smear is reviewed as well for normal trilineage hematopoiesis. A limited volume of marrow was aspirated (max 12 mL) to avoid excessive dilution with peripheral blood, and collected in multiple 3 mL Bone Marrow Prep Syringes (Pharmacy Department, CC, NIH) containing DMEM, heparin and gentamicin. Syringes were properly labeled and transported at room temperature to the CPS laboratory.Frozen cells from different passages were thawed and plated in T75 flasks for 5-7 days. Once they reached 70-80% confluence, cells were collected for single cell separation. Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep Array for mRNA-Seq (10-17um) and Fluidigm C1 system were used for cell capture following the Fluidigm protocol, then reverse transcription and cDNA amplification were performed using the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Clontech, version 1) on the C1 unit. Single-cell cDNA from validation cells were harvested for library preparation. Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kits and Index kits were used for library preparation following the manufacturer’s protocol. Single-cell cDNA libraries from each passage were pooled and cleaned up, then cDNA size distribution was examined by 2100 Bioanalyzer. This was followed by quantification and normalization with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit and BioRad CFX96 qPCR machine (BioRad). Single cell mRNA sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 by using the NextSeq High Output v2 kit (300 cycles). PhiX Control v3 (Illumina) was used as a quality control for sequencing runs.",194
195,"Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic profiling have provided unprecedented access to investigate cell heterogeneity during tissue and organ development. Here, we utilized massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing to define cell heterogeneity within the zebrafish kidney marrow, constructing a comprehensive molecular atlas of definitive hematopoiesis and functionally-distinct renal cells found in adult zebrafish. Because our method analyzed blood and kidney cells in an unbiased manner, our approach was useful in characterizing immune cell deficiencies within prkdcD3612fs, il2rgaY91fs and double homozygous mutant fish, identifying blood cell losses in T, B, and natural killer cells within specific genetic mutants.  Our analysis also uncovered novel cell types including two classes of natural killer immune cells, classically-defined and erythroid-primed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, mucin secreting kidney cells, and kidney stem/progenitor cells. In total, our work provides the first comprehensive single cell transcriptomic analysis of kidney and marrow cells in the adult zebrafish. The goal of our study is to establish the transcriptional profiles of hematopoietic and kidney cell lineages residing in the zebrafish whole kidney marrow. Firstly, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing by a modified Smart-seq2 protocol on sorted single cells from fluorescent transgenic zebrafish lines, which label distinct blood cell types (n = 246 cells total). Secondly, we utilized droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (inDrop) to investigate unmarked, comprehensive hematopoietic lineage structure within wild-type, casper-strain zebrafish (N=3 animals, n=3,782 cells total). From this, we identified ten distinct hematopoietic groups of blood and immune identities. Thirdly, we confirmed blood lineage interpretations by comparing hematopoietic lineages within wild-type fish with mutant zebrafish with known immunodeficiencies, including prkdc(D3612fs) (N=3 animals, n=3,201 cells), il2rga(Y91fs) (N=2 animals, n=2,068 cells) and prkdc(D3612fs), il2rga(Y91fs) double compound mutant fish (N=2 animals, n=2,276 cells). Lastly, we identified seven structural and functional cell lineages of kidney identities in the whole kidney marrow (n=1,699 kidney cells).","Transgenic reporter fish used in this work included Tg(Runx1+23:GFP), Tg(rag2:GFP), Tg(mpx:GFP), Tg(lck:GFP), rag1 mutant fish, Tg(cd41:GFP). Zebrafish kidney marrow were dissected from 3–9-month old transgenic fish, made into single-cell suspensions.Zebrafish cells are isolated from the kidney marrow and resuspended in single cell suspension. Individual cells are sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting into 96-well plates containing 5 ul TCL buffer (QIAGEN) + 1% BME (Bio-Rad). Plates were snap frozen and stored in -80C before reverse transcription and library construction. Whole-transcriptome amplification and library construction were performed on single cells using a modified Smart-seq2 protocol adapted by Venteicher et al. (PMID 28360267). Libraries of uniquely barcoded cells were combined and sequenced with a Nextseq 500 High Output V2 kit (75 cycles) (Illumina) on a NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina).Demultiplexed reads were aligned using STAR(Dobin et al., 2013) to GRCz10. We used picard to filter out PCR duplicates and also removed reads aligning to rRNA intervals. We then assigned counts to each gene using featureCounts(Liao Y, Smyth GK and Shi W 2014).

196,"Recent technological advances in single-cell genomics make it possible to analyze cellular heterogeneity of tumor samples. Here, we applied single-cell RNA-seq to measure the transcriptomes of 307 single cells cultured from three biopsies of three different patients with a BRAF/NRAS wild type, BRAF mutant/NRAS wild type and BRAF wild type/NRAS mutant melanoma metastasis, respectively. Analysis based on self-organizing maps identified sub-populations defined by multiple gene expression modules involved in proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation, pigmentation and cellular stroma. Gene expression modules had prognostic relevance when compared with gene expression data from published melanoma samples and patient survival data. We surveyed kinome expression patterns across sub-populations of the BRAF/NRAS wild type sample and found that CDK4 and CDK2 were consistently highly expressed in the majority of cells, suggesting that these kinases might be involved in melanoma progression. Treatment of cells with the CDK4 inhibitor palbociclib restricted cell proliferation to a similar, and in some cases greater, extent than MAPK inhibitors. Finally, we identified a low abundant sub-population in this sample that highly expressed a module containing ABC transporter ABCB5, surface markers CD271 and CD133, and multiple aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), as markers for melanoma stem or initiating cells. Patient-derived cultures of the BRAF mutant/NRAS wild type and BRAF wild type/NRAS mutant metastases showed more homogeneous single-cell gene expression patterns with gene expression modules for proliferation and ABC transporters. Taken together, our results describe an intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity in melanoma short-term cultures which might be relevant for patient survival, and suggest promising targets for new treatment approaches in melanoma therapy. RNA-seq of 307 single cells cultured from three biopsies of three different patients with a BRAF/NRAS wild type, BRAF mutant/NRAS wild type and BRAF wild type/NRAS mutant melanoma metastasis, respectively.","Three melanoma short-term cultures were used: Ma-Mel-123 (23 passages), Ma-Mel-108 (29 passages), and Ma-Mel-93 (15 passages). All three are derived from subcutaneous metastases. Ma-Mel-123 is BRAF and NRAS wild type, Ma-Mel-108 is BRAF V600E mutant and NRAS wild type, Ma-Mel-93 is BRAF wild type and NRAS G13R mutant. Cell cultures were authenticated immediately before the experiments. Clinical information of Ma-Mel-123, Ma-Mel-108, Ma-Mel-93: age at biopsy in years (67, 35, 75), gender (female, female, male), localization of primary tumor (mucosa, occult, occult), type of primary tumor (mucosal, occult, occult), stage at biopsy (IV, IV, IV), biopsy origin (all cutaneous metastases), and survival in months after biopsy (6.3+, 8.8, 9.2). Single melanoma cells from short-term cultures were captured on an integrated fluidic circuit RNA-seq chip (Fluidigm, Hamburg, Germany) using the Fluidigm C1 system.Cells were loaded onto the chip at a concentration of 200 cells/uL and imaged by phase-contrast. Cell capture, cell lysis, reverse transcription, and cDNA amplification were performed on the chip as described (Camp et al., 2015).Illumina libraries were constructed using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit using the protocol supplied by Fluidigm. Ninety-six libraries were pooled (3 µL each) and purified with SPRI beads. Library concentration and size distribution were assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer and with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kits and a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, Darmstadt). Each cell was paired-end sequenced (100 base reads) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to a depth of 2–5 million reads and base-calling, adaptor trimming, and de-multiplexing were performed as described (Renaud et al., 2013; Renaud et al., 2015).Raw reads were processed using a custom script and aligned to a Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) indexed human genome (grch38 sourced from ENSEMBL) using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009) with default settings. Transcript levels were quantified as fragments per kilobase of mapped reads (FPKM) generated by Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) using gencode protein coding genes (grch38 v22 Havana).

197,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing is revolutionising our understanding of seemingly homogeneous cell populations but has not yet been widely applied to single-celled organisms. Transcriptional variation in unicellular malaria parasites from the Plasmodium genus is associated with critical phenotypes including red blood cell invasion and immune evasion, yet transcriptional variation at an individual parasite level has not been examined in depth. Here, we describe the adaptation of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol to deconvolute transcriptional variation for more than 500 individual parasites of both rodent and human malaria comprising asexual and sexual life-cycle stages. We uncover previously hidden discrete transcriptional signatures during the pathogenic part of the life cycle, suggesting that expression over development is not as continuous as commonly thought. In transmission stages, we find novel, sex-specific roles for differential expression of contingency gene families that are usually associated with immune evasion and pathogenesis.","The original Smart-seq2 protocol with the Superscript II enzyme and the original oligo(dT) with an anchoring base was run with 30 PCR cycles of preamplification on 10 samples. The samples included a single no-cell control, five single P. falciparum gametocytes, two 10-cell controls and two 100-cell controls. These were multiplexed, along with three samples each of individual human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and sequenced on a single MiSeq run with 150bp paired end reads. To test the effect of different reverse transcriptase enzymes and different numbers of PCR cycles, we sequenced P. falciparum schizont libraries prepared using 1) the SmartScribe enzyme (Clontech) for a) six single cells, one 100-cell control and two no-cell controls with 25 cycles of PCR, and b) six single cells and one 100-cell control with 30 cycles of PCR; and 2) the SuperScript II enzyme (Thermofisher) for a) six single cells, one 100-cell control and two no-cell controls with 25 cycles of PCR, and b) six single cells and one 100-cell control with 30 cycles of PCR. These were multiplexed on a single MiSeq run with 150bp paired end reads. To determine whether single-cell samples might be contaminated with either additional cells or RNA from lysed cells, individual mCherry P. berghei (RMgm-928 25) and GFP P. falciparum 27 schizonts were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, inactivated with RNALater fixation and then sorted. A multiplex library was prepared comprising 32 single P. berghei schizonts, two 100-cell P. berghei schizont controls, one no cell control, 40 single P. falciparum schizonts and two 100-cell P. falciparum schizont controls. These libraries were sequenced as a multiplex pool on a single MiSeq run with 150bp paired end reads. The P. berghei mixed blood stage samples comprised 182 single-cells of P. berghei, plus four no-cell controls and six 100-cell controls. These were multiplexed with another 192 samples not analysed in this work and sequenced on a single HiSeq 2500 lane using HiSeq v4 with 75bp paired end reads. The P. falciparum gametocyte samples were sequenced as three multiplexed pools of 84, using the same chemistry. Three technical duplicate samples were excluded from analysis. The P. falciparum asexual samples were sequenced as two pools of 96, each on one Illumina HiSeq 2500 lane using HiSeq v4 chemistry with 75bp paired-end reads. Each batch of 96 samples contained three 100-cell controls. The second batch (lane 7) contained six samples of stage I gametocytes and six samples of stage II gametocytes, each with a single 100-cell control. These were not included in the analysis, leaving 176 single cell samples.Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer recommendations. 96 or 384 different index combinations were used to allow multiplexing during sequencing. After indexing, libraries were pooled for clean-up at a 4:5 ratio of Agencourt Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter). Quality of the libraries was monitored with the high sensitivity DNA chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. Empty-well controls and single cells were pooled separately from 100 cell controls and loaded proportionally to their expected cell content for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq or HISeq 2500.Isolation of P. berghei parasites: The constitutively mCherry-expressing P. berghei ANKA line, clone RMgm-928, was propagated in a female 6- to 8-week-old Theiler’s original outbred mouse supplied by Envigo UK. (RMgm-928 clone modified by introduction of two mCherry-expression cassettes (pL1694 and pL1695) into the GIMOpbANKA. Construct pL1694 contains the hsp70 promoter (5’hsp70)-mCherry-3’hsp70 cassette and construct pL1695 the b9 promoter-mCherry-3’b9 cassette. These constructs are integrated into the modified P. berghei 230p locus containing the hdhfr::yfcu selectable marker cassette by double cross-over homologous recombination at the target regions). Parasites were purified from an overnight (20h) 50 mL culture of 1 mL of infected blood using a 55% Histodenz cushion (SIGMA), following an established schizont purification protocol detailed elsewhere. Purified late stages (asexual and sexual) were pelleted at 450g for 3 minutes and incubated with 500 µL of RNALater (ThermoFisher) for 5 minutes, and further diluted into 3 mL of 1x PBS prior to cell sorting.

Isolation of P. falciparum: 3D7-HTGFP, a GFP-expressing P. falciparum strain 27, was maintained in O-negative red blood cells obtained from the NHSBT, using RPMI 1640 culture medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (SIGMA), 10mM D-Glucose (SIGMA), 50 mg/L hypoxanthine (SIGMA), 10% human serum (obtained locally in accordance with ethically approved protocols), and gassed using a mix containing 5% O2 , 5% CO2 and 90% N2. Parasites were highly synchronised using two consecutive cycles of Percoll-Sorbitol treatment. Late asexual parasites (trophozoites and schizonts) were purified on a cushion of 63% Percoll (GE Healthcare). Stage V gametocytes were obtained using standard gametocyte culturing 29 and purified magnetically with an LS column 30 (Miltenyi Biotec). Following purification of each stage, all P. falciparum parasites were pelleted at 800g for 5 minutes, incubated with 500 µL of RNALater (ThermoFisher) for 5 minutes, and further diluted into 3 mL of 1x PBS prior to cell sorting.

201,"Abstract from Vermillion et al: During vertebrate development, progenitor cells give rise to tissues and organs through a complex choreography that commences at gastrulation. A hallmark event of gastrulation is the formation of the primitive streak, a linear assembly of cells along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the developing organism. To examine the primitive streak at a single-cell resolution, we measured the transcriptomes of individual chick cells from the streak or the surrounding tissue (the rest of the area pellucida) in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 4 embryos. The single-cell transcriptomes were then ordered by the statistical method Wave-Crest to deduce both the relative position along the AP axis and the prospective lineage of single cells. The ordered transcriptomes reveal intricate patterns of gene expression along the primitive streak.   Examination of single-cells of stage 4 chicken embryos.","Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated to Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 4 (approximately 20–27 h at 37 °C with 35–55% humidity) and collected in Ringer’s solution. The embryos were stage-matched; a total of 32 HH stage 4 embryos were used (16 embryos for each single-cell RNA-seq experiment). Primitive streak and surrounding region tissues were dissected and collected from the same embryos. The tissues were treated with dispase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) or accutase (ThermoFisher) for 15 min at 37 °C and then rinsed three times in PBE (PBS + 0.1% BSA + 2 mM EDTA). The tissues were then triturated into clumps of cells in Ringer’s solution + 0.5% BSA and spun down for 7 min at 300 x g. The clumps of cells were then dissociated with 1 mL accutase for 10 min at 37 °C. Single cells were filtered through a 40 µm strainer and spun down for 3 min at 300 × g. The cells were resuspended in Ringer’s solution + 0.5% BSA. Cells were evaluated and counted using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen).Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated for 22-24 hours to reach Hamburger-Hamilton Stage 4.Hamburger-Hamilton Stage 4 chicken embryos were collected in Ringer's solution. The primitive streak was dissected out using a fine tungsten needle, and the remaining surrounding tissue (rest of the area pellucida) was collected separately. Single-cell cDNA libraries were prepared with the Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System following a previously described approach (Leng et al., 2015). Single chick cells were loaded into small-sized (5–10 µm) C1 Single–Cell Auto Prep integrated fluidic circuits (IFCs, Fluidigm). After cells were loaded in the IFCs, capture sites were examined with an EVOS FL Auto Cell Imaging System (Life Technologies). Each capture site was evaluated and those sites without a cell or those containing more than one cell were excluded from subsequent library preparation. To carry out reverse transcription and amplification of cDNAs, the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit and the Advantage 2 PCR Kit (both kits from Clontech) were employed. The resulting cDNAs were fragmented and amplified using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation and Index Kits (Illumina).

204,"We describe a so far uncharacterized, embryonic and self-renewing Neural Plate Border Stem Cell (NBSC) population with the capacity to differentiate into central nervous and neural crest lineages. NBSCs can be obtained by neural transcription factor-mediated reprogramming (BRN2, SOX2, KLF4, and ZIC3) of human adult dermal fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (induced Neural Plate Border Stem Cells, iNBSCs) or by directed differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (NBSCs). Moreover, human (i)NBSCs share molecular and functional features with primary Neural Plate Border Stem Cells (pNBSCs) isolated from neural folds of E8.5 mouse embryos. Here we provide single cell RNA-sequencing data of neural tissue derived from two E8.5 mouse embryos. After manual isolation and enzymatic separation E8.5 neural tissue was single cell sorted and RNA sequencing was performed following the Smart-seq2 protocol. In sum, cultured pNBSCs and E8.5 neural tube cells share a similar regional identity and expression signature suggesting that pNBSCs might correspond to an endogenous progenitor in this area of the developing brain.","Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed following the Smart-seq2 protocol with adaptation as outlined below (Picelli et al.

205,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the opportunity to examine transcriptional variation within populations of apparently homogeneous cells. We developed an optimised protocol to assess variability across individual Plasmodium parasites, and then use scRNA-seq to uncover variation in unicellular eukaryotic organisms for the first time. In this dataset we used single cell RNA-seq to determine whether different parasite stages could be resolved among the Plasmodium berghei mixed blood stage transcriptomes. NOTE: This dataset represents a subset of the original ERP021229 containing only cells of mixed asexual and sexual blood stage parasites of the rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei","The constitutively mCherry-expressing P. berghei ANKA line, clone RMgm-928 (Khan et al., 2013), was propagated in a female 6- to 8-week-old Theilers original outbred mouse supplied by Envigo UK. Parasites were purified from an overnight (20 hr) 50 mL culture of 1 mL of infected blood using a 55% Histodenz cushion (SIGMA), following an established schizont purification protocol detailed elsewhere (Gomes et al., 2015). Purified late stages (asexual and sexual) were pelleted at 450 g for 3 min and incubated with 500 ul of RNALater (ThermoFisher) for 5 min, and further diluted into 3 ml of 1x PBS prior to cell sorting. All animal researches were conducted under licenses from the UK Home Office and used protocols approved by the ethics committee of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.Cell sorting was conducted on an Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences) with a 70 um nozzle. Parasites were sorted by gating on single-cell events and on mCherry (P. berghei) fluorescence. A non-sorted negative control well and a positive 100-cell control well were included in every plate alongside single cells.

206,"To address how intratumoral heterogeneity affects anti-cancer drug responses, we profiled transcriptomes of single cancer cells originating from lung adenocarcinoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors.  We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) together with bulk sequencing by applying Smart-Seq protocol (Ramsköld et al., Nat Biotechnol 2012). Enrichment of cancer cells in PDX from primary tumor (LC-PT-45: bulk RNA-Seq, n=1) was identified by histopathological examination and genomic signatures. Tumor cell-enriched PDX cells (LC-PT-45: scRNA-Seq, n=34; bulk RNA-Seq, n=9) were analyzed, and additional batch (LC-Pt-45-Re: scRNA-Seq, n=43; bulk RNA-Seq, n=7) was obtained to check comparable results. H358 human lung cancer cells (scRNA-Seq, n=50; bulk RNA-Seq, n=1) were used as cell line controls. Another lung cancer PDX case (LC-MBT-15: scRNA-Seq, n=49; bulk RNA-Seq, n=7) was prepared to validate our analytical strategy applied in the LC-PT-45 case.","For drug screening, PDX cells in the serum free sphere culture condition were seeded in 384-well plates (500 cells/well). Two hours after plating, cells were treated with a drug library (Selleck, Houston, TX) in 3 folds and 10 points serial dilution (n=3 for each condition). After 6 days incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator, cell viability was analyzed using an ATP monitoring system based on firefly luciferase (ATPliteTM 1step, PerkinElmer, Waltham, CA). Test concentrations for each drug have been derived empirically to produce a clinically relevant spectrum of drug activity. Dose response curves and corresponding half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration values (IC50) were calculated using the S+ Chip Analyzer (Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Suwon, Korea).Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and within the protocols approved by the appropriate IRB at the Samsung Medical Center. Xenograft tumor specimens were dissociated into single cells. Dissociated cells were cultured in neurobasal media-A supplemented with N2 (×1/2), B27 (×1/2) (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA), bFGF/EGF (25ng/ml each), neuregulin 1 (hNRG1, 10ng/ml), and long-insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1, 100ng/ml) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). As spheres appeared in suspension culture conditions, they were dissociated with accutase (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany) and expanded by reseeding. RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the human genome reference (hg19) together with splice junction information of each sample using the 2-pass mode of STAR_2.4.0d.

Participants in this study gave written informed consent for research and publication of the results. Surgical specimens were acquired from a 60-year-old male patient who underwent surgical resection of a 37-mm irregular primary lung lesion in the right middle lobe (LC-PT-45), and from a 57-year-old female patient who underwent surgical resection of a metachronous brain metastasis (LC-MBT-15). The LC-PT-45 tumor was taken in a treatment-naïve status whereas the LC-MBT-15 tumor was taken after standard chemotherapy and erlotinib treatments. Pathologic examination of the primary tumors revealed a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma based on the World Health Organization criteria [49]. The PDX cells were isolated and cultured in vitro as described previously [24, 30, 50]. Briefly, surgically removed tumor tissues were directly injected into the subrenal space of 6–8-week-old humanized immunocompromised female NOG (NOD/Shi- SCID/IL-2Rγ-null) mice (Orient Bio, Seongnam, Korea). Xenograft tumors were taken from the mice for PDX cell culture and validated by short tandem repeat DNA fingerprinting as having been derived from the original tumor. We used PDX cells at fewer than three in vitro passages for single-cell RNA-seq and drug screening. Animal care and handling was performed according to the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication no.80-23, revised 1978).",206

208,"The capability of T cells for discrimination between self and non-self peptides is based on rigorous negative selection of developing thymocytes by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). The mTECs purge autoreactive T cells by expression of cell-type specific genes referred to as tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), therefore, the expression patterns of TRA genes can help understand development of mTECs and the regulatory mechanism during the development. We use single-cell RNA-sequencing to resolve patterns of TRA expression, and to elucidate how these patterns are changed during mTEC development.  Thymi were collected from 2 and 4 week-old wild-type male and female mice. The mTEC suspension obtained from sorting was loaded onto the Fluidigm C1 platform using mediumsized capture chips (10-17m cells).

This was done because unstressed and stressed cells displayed different sensitivities to zymolyase digest. After incubation, cells were spun at 250 g for four min and resuspended in Sorbitol Wash buffer (0.455x C1 Cell Wash Buffer, 1 M sorbitol, 0.2 ug/μl BSA, 0.08(8) U/uL SUPERase RNAse Inhibitor). Samples with the maximal number of intact spheroplasts (compared on a Leica DMI 6000 inverted microscope) were diluted to a final concentration of 600 cells/uL, and 9 uL of these cells were mixed with Fluidigm Suspension reagent at final loading concentration of 275 cells/uL and loaded onto the primed C1 Chip designed to capture 5–10-um cells, according to manufacturer instructions. Spheroplasts were lysed in the Fluidigm instrument and cDNA was generated using Clontech reagents for Fluidigm C1 based on the single-cell RNA-seq protocol (cat 635025). Finally, cDNA was harvested from each Fluidigm C1 chip and into a 96-well plate for storage at −20C. ERCC spike-in sequences (mix A) were added at 1:4 × 105/uL of the concentration provided in the original product (Ambion catalog number 4456740).One hundred ng of each pool was combined and sequenced in one run on three lanes of an Illumina HiSeq-2500 1T v4 sequencer for 150-bp paired-end sequencing.",209
210,"Increasing evidence indicates that minor subpopulations intrinsic to androgen-independence are present in prostate cancer cells, poised to become clonal dominance under prolonged androgen-deprivation selection. To stratify different subpopulations, we conduct transcriptome profiling of 144 single LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated and untreated with androgen after cell cycle synchronization. At least eight subpopulations of LNCaP cells are identified, revealing a previously unappreciable level of cellular heterogeneity to androgen stimulation. One subpopulation displays stem-like features, the advanced growth of which depends more on enhanced expression of 10 cell cycle-related genes and less on androgen-dependent signaling. Concordant upregulation of these genes appears to be linked to recurrent prostate cancers and can be used for early detection of tumors that subsequently develop androgen independence. Moreover, this single-cell approach provides a better understanding of how cancer cells respond heterogeneously to androgen-deprivation therapies and to reveal which subpopulations are resistant to this treatment. For each of 3 treatment groups, forty eight LNCaP single cells and 1 representative bulk cell RNA sample (1ng) were collected for SMART-seq2 amplification and later single-cell RNA-seq (total 144 single cells and 3 bulk cell samples). All of the treatment groups were harvested from after synchronizing the cells at the G1/S phase with a double thymidine block and androgen depriving the cells for ~24 hours.

All embryos were obtained with written informed consent signed by the donor couples. The informed consent confirmed that the couple donors were voluntarily donating oocytes and embryos (including sperm) for research on human early embryonic development mechanisms with no financial payment (Research License 2011S2003). The couples donating eggs and embryos before the 8-cell stage were informed that the donation posed a potential risk to their fertility success for that cycle. The embryos used for the derivation of hESCs were obtained for this purpose with the signed informed consent from the donor couples (Research License 2011S2018). Patients: Embryos were obtained from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the Center for Reproductive Medicine of Peking University Third Hospital using standard clinical protocols as described46. The women had an average age of 30 years (25–35 years), tubal-factor infertility and partners with normal semen parameters. hESCs were cultured on mitotically inactivated MEF feeder layers derived from E13.5 embryos of the ICR strain.

After an initial growth period of 10 d, the cell colonies derived from the ICM were removed from the dish by mechanical slicing using glass capillaries drawn on a flame and with a sealed tip. The cell clusters were transferred to new plates containing fresh feeder cells. After the first splitting, the new colonies were again split and transferred to new dishes every 5 d. Half of the culture medium was changed every day.

Single cell RNA-Seq data of two independent experiments comprising 80 and 72 cells were obtained as paired-end reads. Cell samples contained typically 4-6 million reads.  An unbiased quality filter in the RNA-seq data pipeline required each cell to show total transcript counts >1e5, yielding 144 cells. A second quality filter specific for marker genes that were associated with the process under study (Phox2b, Erbb3, Fabp7, Elavl4, Ret, Plp1, Sox10 and Tubb3) required each cell to show total marker transcript counts >1e3, yielding 120 cells.

216,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) initiated from the renal epithelium is the most prevalent histological type of adult kidney cancers. Dissecting intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) of ccRCC has leveraged to extend our knowledge on how primary tumors harboring driver mutations evolve and spread to other sites. The cellular fractions within and across the primary (pRCC) and metastatic RCC (mRCC) are heterogeneous in both their genetic and biological features determining the variability in clinical aggressiveness and sensitivity to the therapy. To achieve sustainable therapeutic benefit with targeted agents in mRCC, the effective target should focus on signaling pathways that are related to driver mutations occurred early in the clonal evolution of the disease and thus should be common to primary tumor and metastatic sites. Considering that extensive genetic heterogeneity may result in drug response variability among patients and treatment resistance, the tailored strategies for metastatic RCC is urgently needed. Here, we analyze single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from a matched primary RCC (pRCC) and lung metastasis (mRCC) to dissect ITH at the highest resolution to date with the objective of discovering the better therapeutic regimen. In order to identify successful clonal propagation from patient to PDX samples and understand pathogenesis from primary to metastatic RCC, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES, n=4) and matched aCGH (n=4) on bulk tumor samples. And we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to model and dissect functional heterogeneity acroass primary and metastatic RCC tumors. We checked whether of capturing live one cell, not more cells, in microfluidics by fluorescent microscopic observation. To construct RNA sequencing libraries, we performed further quality controls including adequate quantities and qualities of amplified transcriptomes respectively from single cells. Tumor cells from the parental mRCC (n=34), PDX-mRCC (n=36) and PDX-pRCC (n=46) were finally analyzed in this study after filtering out poor quality cells.","For PDX samples, RNA-seq reads only mapped to the mouse genome reference (mm10) were removed.

A participant in this study gave written informed consent for research and publication of the results. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and within the protocols approved by the appropriate IRB at the Samsung Medical Center. After validating the origin of each xenograft by short tandem repeat DNA fingerprinting, sacrified tumor tissues together with prepared patient metastasis tumor samples were dissociated to implement C1™ Single-Cell Auto Prep System.In order to isolate single-cells and amplify initial RNA content enough to transcriptome sequencing, we adopted the C1TM Single-Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm, CA, USA) with the SMARTer kit (Clontech, CA, USA). Briefly, cells isolated from human mRCC, PDX-mRCC, and paired PDX-pRCC tumors were subjected to single-cell capture and cDNA amplification using the C1™ Single-Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA, USA) with the SMARTer kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). RNA-seq reads for single cells and bulk samples were generated using the HiSeq 2500 in the 100-bp paired-end mode and reads that only mapped to the mouse genome reference (mm10) were subsequently removed. Cells were captured on the C1 chip (17-25 μm) and determined as a live single cell by fluorescence microscopic observation. Quantity and quality of amplified cDNAs from individual single cells were checked by Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA) and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Inc., CA, USA).  Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruction, assayed the quantity and quality, pooled, and then sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) using the 100bp paired-end mode of the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster kit and TruSeq Rapid SBS kit (Illumina) at the Samsung Genome Institute (Seoul, Korea). PDXs were established using surgically resected matched pRCC (pT1Nx; Fuhrman Grade 3) and paired lung metastasis from a 43-year-old man with ccRCC who experienced solitary lung metastasis 1 year after radical nephrectomy (IRB number 2010-04-004). He showed signs of rapid tumor dissemination to the bone, lung, pleura, and brain despite multiple salvage regimens, including pazopanib, everolimus, and high-dose interleukin (IL)-2, and finally died 16 months after complete metastatectomy as a result of rapid tumor progression. Serial 5-μm sections from each formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and examined by a specialized pathologist.  Establishment of orthotopic PDXs: Athymic nude mice were obtained from Orient Bio (Seoul, Korea). Fresh tumor tissue was obtained from pRCC tissue of the patient by surgical excision under sterile conditions and matched fresh tumor tissue was taken from the mRCC. Each biopsied parental tumor mass was chopped into fragments, and was frozen or placed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for later analyses. A blood pellet was used for extraction of germline DNA. Fresh tumor tissue was stored on ice in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) for transport. For transplantation, 6- to 8-week-old NOD scid gamma mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Primary tumor and paired lung metastasis samples minced into approximately 1-mm3 fragments in high-concentration Matrigel TM Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were directly implanted into the subrenal capsule (n = 4–5 for each tumor sample). For subrenal capsule implantation, xenograft tumor engraftment was defined as a palpable mass of >1 mm in diameter with pathologic confirmation. When the resulting tumors grew, each tumor (F1 generation) was resected as the primary tumor, divided, and passaged into five mice (F2 generation). The PDX tumors were harvested and divided into three samples for generation of second in vivo passage xenograft tumors, DNA/RNA extraction, and histopathologic examination. The origin of each xenograft was validated by short tandem repeat DNA fingerprinting. The process was repeated to produce subsequent generations via subcutaneous implantation in BALB/c nude mice to expand xenograft numbers.",216
217,"Motivation: The B-cell receptor (BCR) performs essential functions for the adaptive immune system including recognition of pathogen-derived antigens. The vast repertoire and adaptive variation of BCR sequences due to V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) necessitates single-cell characterization of BCR sequences. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) presents the opportunity for simultaneous capture of paired BCR heavy and light chains and the transcriptomic signature.  Results: We developed VDJPuzzle, a novel bioinformatic tool that reconstructs productive, full-length B-cell receptor sequences of both heavy and light chains. VDJPuzzle successfully reconstructed BCRs from 98.3% (n=117) human and 96.5% (n=200) murine B cells. The reconstructed BCRs were successfully validated with single-cell Sanger sequencing.  Availability: VDJPuzzle is available at https://bitbucket.org/kirbyvisp/vdjpuzzle2","PBMCs were separated from freshly-collected whole blood by density gradient centrifugation and stained with the following monoclonal antibodies: CD19-BV421 (Biolegend), IgD-PerCP- Cy5.5, CD27-PE-Cy7, CD38-APC, CD10-PECF594, CD3-APC-Cy7, IgG-BV605 (BD Biosciences) and viability dye eFluor780 (eBioscience) for 30 min on ice and, following two washes, cells were resuspended in PBS with 1% HI bovine serum for single cell sorting. Following exclusion of non-viable/CD3+ cells, individual transitional (CD19+, IgD+, CD27-,CD10+), mature naïve (CD19+, IgD+, CD27-, CD10-), switched memory (CD19+, IgD-, CD27+, IgG+) and plasmablast (CD19+, IgD-, CD27++, CD38++) were sorted directly into 96- well PCR plates (Eppendorf) using a FACS ARIA III (BD Biosciences). PCR plates were stored at –80 C for subsequent analysis.polyA tailSingle cell RNA sequencing was performed with the Smart-Seq2 protocol as described by Picelli et al. (Picelli, et al., 2013; Picelli, et al., 2014) with the following modifications. Cell lysis buffer was prepared by adding 1μL Rnase inhibitor (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to 19μl Triton X- 100 solution (0.2% v/v). Cells were sorted directly into 96-well plates containing 1μL lysis buffer, 0.5μL dNTP (10mM) and 0.5μL oligo-dT primer at 5uM. Reverse-transcription and PCR amplification were performed as described (Picelli, et al., 2013) with the following exceptions: reactions were performed at half volumes, the IS PCR primer was reduced to a 50nM final concentration and the number of PCR cycles increased to 28.

218,"Prostate organogenesis involves epithelial growth in response to inductive signalling from specialised subsets of mesenchyme. To identify regulators and morphogens active in mesenchyme, we performed transcriptomic analysis using Tag-seq, RNA-seq, and single cell RNA-seq and defined new mesenchymal subsets and markers. We documented transcript expression using Tag-seq and RNA-seq in female rat Ventral Mesenchymal Pad (VMP) as well as adjacent urethra comprised of smooth muscle and peri-urethral mesenchyme. Transcripts enriched in VMP were identified in Tag-seq data from microdissected tissue, and RNA-seq data derived from cell populations and single cells. We identified 400 transcripts as enriched or specific to the VMP using bio-informatic comparisons of Tag-seq and RNA-seq data. Comparison with single cell RNA-seq identified transcripts yielded 45 transcriptscommon to both approaches. Cell subset analysis showed that VMP and adjacent mesenchyme were composed of distinct cell types and that each tissue was comprised of two subgroups. Markers for these subgroups were highly subset specific. Thirteen transcripts were validated by qPCR to confirm cell specific expression in microdissected tissues, as well as expression in neonatal prostate. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that Ebf3 and Meis2 showed a restricted expression pattern in VMP condensed mesenchyme. Taken together, we demonstrate that the VMP shows limited cellular heterogeneity and that our high-resolution transcriptomic analysis identified new mesenchymal subset markers associated with prostate organogenesis. Tag-sequencing, RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing on 2 female inductive mesenchymal tissues of the developing prostate/urogenital tract.","Wistar female rats were housed under a 12-hour light/dark cycle and maintained on standard laboratory diet, the study was performed under MUHC animal protocol number 2015–7670, approved by the McGill University Facility Animal Care Committee (FACC). Newborn (P0) pups were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and decapitation (in accordance with local guidelines and regulations), followed by removal of the urogenital tract and microdissection of the urethra into VMP and SU components using a Leica MZ6 dissection microscope.VMP and SU tissues were disscociated with 2mg/mL Collagenase 1A (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) for 60 minutes at 37C. Dispersed fibroblasts were separated by centrifugation and passing through a 0.7 um cell strainer (Falcon, Corning, New York, USA). Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500g and resuspended in LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability/Cytotoxicity Assay for mammalian cells (ThermoFisher, L-3224). After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in Cell Wash Buffer (Fluidigm). Cell concentration, size and viability were verified on hemocytometers (Incyto DHC-N01-5) through bright field, GFP and RFP on a EVOS FL Auto microscope (ThermoFisher). Single cell RNA libraries were constructed according to the Fluidigm protocol using C1 to generate libraries for RNA sequencing (PN 100-7168). Briefly, full length mRNA-Seq libraries were generated from single-cells captured on the Fluidigm C1 platform using SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit (P/N 634936 Clontech). ERCC RNA Spike-In mix (P/N 4456740 ThermoFisher) was added to the lysis mix for normalization and quality control purposes. Full length cDNAs were converted into sequence ready libraries using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (P/N FC-131-1096 Illumina).Single cell libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 with paired-end 100bp read option. The Fluidigm C1 platform captured 52 and 70 single cells from VMP and SU respectively. The average full length cDNA yield/min/max were 6.06ng(+/-0.12)/2.25ng/14.81ng for VMP and 8.51ng(+/-0.21)/2.55ng/26.6ng for SU. Libraries from 52 VMP and 63 SU single cells were sequenced.Raw paired-end reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.33, to a minimum length of 30 nucleotides. Illumina Nextera XT adapters were removed in palindrome mode. A minimum Phred quality score of 30 was required for the 3’end. Single end reads as well as paired end reads failing previous minimum quality controls were discarded. Individual read groups were aligned, using TopHat first against the rat transcriptome as defined by the Ensembl gene models version 83, with default parameters and the remaining unmapped genes to the Ensembl Rnor_6.0 reference rat genome from Illumina iGenomes web site. Trimming rates and insert length were controlled on each read group based on metrics reported by Trimmomatic, and Picard v1.128 respectively. Aligned reads from multiple read groups belonging to the same sample were indexed, sorted and merged using sambamba v0.5.1, a faster implementation of the Samtools algorithms. Amplification duplicates were removed using Picard v1.128. Various quality controls from the RNA-SeQC package were used, including the genes detected, mapping rates, duplication rates, and intronic rate, based on metrics collected for each sample used. Read counts were quantified using HTSeq Count using Ensembl Rnor_6.0 v83 GTF Genome_build: Ensembl Rnor_6.0 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Raw read count csv file was generated using HTSeq Count.",218
219,"Stable zebrafish cell lines were created that expressed GFP under the control of a previously characterized mouse Smarcd3 enhancer (10.7554/eLife.03848). Specifically, the 2.7 kb Mouse Smarcd3-F6 sequence (chr5: 24113559 -24116342 from mm9 assembly) was sub-cloned from a gateway entry vector into the Zebrafish Enhancer Detection (ZED). Tol2-mediated transgenesis was performed and stable lines were created. The Smarcd3-F6:EGFPhsc70 allele was used for all genomics experiments. Smarcd3-F6:EGFPhsc70 embryos were dissociated at 10 hours post fertilization for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to collect GFP+ cells. Single-cell cDNA libraries were prepared using Fluidgim C1 system ((Fluidgim, PN 100-7168 Rev. B1)). 96 single-cell libraries were collected from three batches of experiments and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data from 92 cells (number of genes detected > 2000) were kept for clustering analysis. For the tube control experiments we performed mRNA-seq on ~4000 cells from the same embryo batches as the scRNA-seq experiments. GFP negative cells were also included to enable a GFP+ versus GFP- comparison.  Libraries were made following the Fluidgim C1 mRNA-seq tube control protocol (Fluidgim, PN 100-7168 Rev. B1). Polyadenylated mRNA was captured by Oligo-dT primers and PCR amplified after reverse transcription. Final sequencing libraries were made using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit and pair-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.","Around 100 Tg(Smarcd3-F6: EGFP) embryos were dechorionated with pronase (Sigma, Cat# 11459643001) and transferred to a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube when they reached bud stage. After incubated in 200ul calcium-free Ringer solution (116 mM NaCl, 2.6mM KCl, 5mM HEPE, pH 7.0) for 5 min, embryos were transferred into a 24-well plate filled with 500 ul TrypLE solution (GIBOCO, TrypLE Express Enzyme, cat #: 12604-013) for dissociation at room temperature.  Embryos were gently homogenized every 5min with P1000 tips. Dissociation was monitored under a dissection scope until most cells were in single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was transferred into 200ul ice-cold FBS to stop the reaction. Cells were centrifuged at 300g for 3min at 4 degree and washed with 500 ul ice-cold DMEM with 10% FBS before resuspended in 500 ul ice-cold DMEM with 1% FBS. Right before the FACS, cells were filtered through a 40um strainer and DAPI was added at a concentration of 5 ug/ml to exclude dead cells. FACS was performed on Beckman Coulter Mo Flo XDP or Mo Flo Astrios sorter with a 100um nozzle by the SickKids-UHN Flow and Mass Cytometry Facility. Cell-doublets and dead cells were excluded based on forward scatter, side scatter and DAPI channel. GFP+ and GFP- cells were sorted into 100% FBS and subjected to RNA-seq or procedures immediately once sorting finished. 30,000-50,000 GFP+ cells and 100, 000 GFP- cells were usually collected in one sort.Final sequencing libraries were made using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, Cat# FC-131-1096).Single-cell cDNA libraries were prepared using Fluidgim C1 system. After FACS, GFP positive cells were washed twice in DMEM with 3%FBS and filtered through a 40um cell strainer. Cells were adjusted to a concentration of 400-500 cells/ul before mixed with C1 suspension solution at a 5.2:4.8 ratio. Then 10ul final cell mixture was loaded into a C1 medium or small Chip. Cell capture was examined under a microscope and only wells with a single cell captured were included in library construction. Reverse transcription, PCR amplification and cDNA harvesting were performed as per manufactures instruction.  Since the optimized capture efficiency of C1 chip for our cell is 30-40%, 96 single-cell cDNA libraries were collected from three batches of experiments at the end.120bp pair-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform according to manufacturers instruction.

Flourescence-activated cell sorting was used to infer G1, S or G2/M cell cycle stages after staining cells for DNA content. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed according to the Smart-seq2 protocol.","Sequencing libraries were generated using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit and Nextera XT v2 Index Kit (both Illumina), following the manufacturer’s recommendations with minor changes. In short, 0.1 ng of purified and preamplified cDNA were tagmented in 20 µl, containing 10 µl TD buffer and 5 µl ATM at 55°C for 5 min. Tagmentation was stopped by adding 5 µl of NT buffer at room temperature incubating for another 5 min. Incorporation of index sequences was performed in 50 µl, containing 15 µl NPM PCR master mix solution, 5 µl i5 index primer and 5 µl i7 index primer, as follows: heating to 72°C for 3 min, denaturation at 95°C for 30 s and 16 cycles of amplification (95°C for 10 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s), and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min before chilling to 10°C.

Reverse transcription (RT) was then performed in 15 µl by adding 1x first-strand buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, and 3 mM MgCl2, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM DTT, additional 10 mM MgCl2 (both Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.6 µM adapter sequence-containing template switching oligonucleotide (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrG+G-3’ where rG = riboguanosine and +G = locked nucleic acid modified guanosine, Eurogentec), 15 U RNaseOUT and 150 U SuperScript II enzyme (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) RT was performed at 42°C for 90 min and 70°C for 15 min before being chilled to 4°C. Final RT concentrations are shown. cDNA was stored at -20°C until further use. Preamplification of 7.5 µl cDNA was then performed in 50 µl, containing 1x KAPA Hifi HotStart Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems) and 60 nM adapter sequence-matching primer (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3’, Sigma-Aldrich), as follows: denaturation at 98°C for 3 min followed by 24 cycles of amplification (98°C for 20 s, 67°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 6 min) and a final incubation at 72°C for 5 min before being chilled to 4°C. Preamplified cDNA was purified using the AMPure XP beads kit (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter), according to the Smart-seq2 protocol, with a sample to beads volume ratio of 0.8. Purified cDNA was eluted in 15 µl water and stored at -20°C until further use. Concentration, fragment length distribution, and total transcriptome amount of preamplified libraries were analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).For single-cell sampling, 1 million trypsinized MLS 1765-92 cells/ml were resuspended in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stained for nuclear DNA using Vybrant DyeCycle Violet stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and a final concentration of 5 µM for 30 min. After staining, the cells were resuspended in Hanks’ balanced salt solution and filtered via a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to remove cell aggregates. The cells were kept on ice until sorting. Single cells were sorted according to cell cycle phases G1, S, and G2/M into 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 5 µl 1 µg/µl BSA in 2.5% glycerol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in DNase/RNase-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a BD FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson) instrument and the FACSDiva software.

221,"We describe a so far uncharacterized, embryonic and self-renewing Neural Plate Border Stem Cell (NBSC) population with the capacity to differentiate into central nervous and neural crest lineages. NBSCs can be obtained by neural transcription factor-mediated reprogramming (BRN2, SOX2, KLF4, and ZIC3) of human adult dermal fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (induced Neural Plate Border Stem Cells, iNBSCs) or by directed differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (NBSCs). Moreover, human (i)NBSCs share molecular and functional features with an endogenous NBSC population isolated from neural folds of E8.5 mouse embryos. Upon differentiation, iNBSCs give rise to either (1) radial glia-type stem cells, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, motoneurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes or (2) cells from the neural crest lineage. Here we provide single cell RNA-sequencing data of two primary mouse Neural Plate Border Stem Cell Lines (pNBSCs). pNBSCs were single cell sorted and RNA sequencing was performed following the Smart-seq2 protocol. In sum, pNBSCs and iNBSCs share a similar regional identity, expression signature and analogous differentiation dynamics on the single-cell-level, suggesting the presence of a transient, NBSC-like progenitor during the neurulation stage of mouse and likely also human embryos.","Mouse pNBSCs were derived from a mixed 129X1/SvJ background and are homozygous for Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo (see also Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 007576). Primary Neural Plate Border Stem cells (pNBSCs) were harvested by treatment with Accutase and washed twice with unsupplemented DMEM/ F12. Cell sorting was carried out on a BD FACSAria™ III sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The following sort parameters were used: 100µm nozzle; up to 800 events/second.

(2014). Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2. Nature Protocols, 9(1), 171–181. ).Plates containing single cells in lysis buffer were thawed on ice, incubated at 72°C for 3 minutes and reverse transcribed using the SmartScribe RT Kit (Takara Bio Clontech): 2µl Smart FS buffer, 0.5µl DTT, 0.1µl 100µM TSO, 1µl SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase, 1.4µl H2O per cell.

222,The aim of this experiment was to investigate cellular heterogeneity of VE-Cadherin+ cells isolated from mouse E10.5 aorta-gonad-mesonephros region.,"Embryos from pregnant mice were collected at 10.5 days of pregnancy. A total of 15 embryos was dissected to isolate the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. The fifteen AGM samples were combined and stained with antibodies specific for VE-Cadherin (endothelial specific) and CD41(blood specific) cell surface markers. Cells expressing VE-Cadherin were sorted on a FACS sorter and loaded on a Fluidigm C1 10–17 uM IFC Chip. Annotation of cell capture was carried out on a brightfield microscope at 40x magnification and each captured site was noted for having single-cell capture, doublet cell capture or debris. A total of 83 chambers out of the 96 in the IFC chip contained single cells. Lysis, reverse transcription, and PCR reagents (Clontech Takara) were then loaded into appropriate inlets as per Fluidigm layout. ERCC spike-in controls (Ambion) were added at a dilution of 1:4000 within the lysis mix to gain limit of detection and normalisation in downstream analysis.Illumina library preparation was carried out using the Nextera XT DNA system (Illumina), but volumes were reduced as per the modified Fluidigm C1 protocol. Tagmentation was performed on all 96 samples using 1.25 ul of cDNA (125 pg total concentration) combined with 2.5 ul of tagmentation buffer (TD) and 1.25 ul of Amplicon Tagment Mix (ATM), and incubated for 10 min at 55 degrees. After incubation, 1.25 ul of Neutrilize Tagment Mix (NT) was added. Illumina PCR barcoded indexes were combined to obtain 96 distinct combinations of i7 and i5 barcodes, and 2.5 ul of combined index was added along with 3.75 ul of Nextera PCR Mix (NPM).

224,"Adipose tissue in the mammary gland undergoes dramatic remodeling during reproduction. Adipocytes are replaced by mammary alveolar structures during pregnancy and lactation, then reappear upon weaning. Here, we reveal that adipocytes in the mammary gland de-differentiate into Pdgfrα+ preadipocyte- and fibroblast-like cells during pregnancy, and remain de-differentiated during lactation. Upon weaning, de-differentiated fibroblasts proliferate and re-differentiate into adipocytes. In order to determine the molecular signature of these de-differentiated adipocytes in the mammary gland, we compared these cells with classical adipocytes. Using the AdipoChaser-mT/mG system, we pre-labeled mature adipocytes with GFP expression to characterize the features of these de-differentiated adipocytes (Figure 4A), and then purified CD31-/CD45-/PDGFRα+/Tomato+ and CD31-/CD45-/PDGFRα+/GFP+ cells from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of lactating mammary gland at the peak of lactation through FACS. Gene expression analyses showed that the CD31-/CD45-/PDGFRα+/Tomato+ cells were indeed enriched with Tomato expression, while the CD31-/CD45-/PDGFRα+/GFP+ cells were enriched with GFP expression (Figure 4C). We then collected CD31-/CD45-/PDGFRα+/GFP+ cells as single cells for subsequent single cell RNA-sequencing analysis (Figure 4D-G, Supplemental. Figure S1A-G). After the flow sorting and single cell RNA amplification, 26 CD31-/CD45-/PDGFRα+/GFP+ cells passed the quality control, and these cells were used for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Due to technical difficulties in sorting single mature white adipocyte through flow cytometry, adipocytes differentiated from the immortalized murine-derived brown pre-adipocyte cell line were used as mature adipocyte control (Pradhan et al., 2017). Additionally, we also included population RNA-seq experiments, i.e. three mature white adipocyte samples, two GFP+, and six GFP- ones.","Mice were on doxycycline food (600mg/kg chow) for 7 days (10-11 weeks old). SVF fractions from the mammary gland were obtained from female mice. Briefly, dissected mammary glands were digested for 1 hour at 37 degree in PBS containing 10 mM CaCl2, 2.4 units/mL dispase II (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) and 1.5 units/mL collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN). Digested cell/tissue mixture was filtered through a 100 µm cell strainer to remove undigested tissues. The flow-through cells was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 600xg at 4ºC. Cell pellet was resuspended in complete SVF culture medium (DMEM/F12 Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; plus Glutamax, Pen/Strep, and 10% FBS) and then filtered through a 40 µM cell strainer to remove clumps and large adipocytes. Samples of SVF cells from the mammary glands (subcutaneous adipose tissue) were first incubated on ice for 20 minutes in 200 uL of 2% FBS/PBS containing anti-mouse CD16/CD32 Fc Block (clone 2.4G2) (1:200). Cells were then incubated with primary antibody (anti-CD31 clone 390 1:200, anti-CD45 clone 30-F11 1:200, CD140a clone APA5 1:100) and were incubated rotating at 4°C for 30 minutes. They were then washed three times with 2% FBS/PBS, and either analyzed using a FACSCantoIITM flow cytometer or sorted by a FACSAriaTM flow cytometer (UT Southwestern Medical Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility). For sorting, cells were initially selected by size, on the basis of forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC). Live cells were then gated on both SSC and FSC Width singlets, ensuring that individual cells were analyzed. SVF cells isolated from wild-type mice, along with fluorescent-minus-one (FMO) controls, were used to determine background fluorescence levels. All flow cytometry antibodies were rat-derived and conjugated to APC or PE. All antibodies were obtained commercially from BioLegend (San Diego, CA USA). The single-cell RNA-seq was performed using the Smart-seq2 method (Picelli et al., 2013), with several modifications . Briefly, single cells were sorted by FACS into 96-well PCR plate with lysis buffer (2 ul of 0.2% TritonX-100, 1 ul of dNTP (10 uM each), 1 ul of 10 uM biotin-oligo-dT30VN oligo, 0.1 ul of 40U/ul Rnase Inhibitor (Clontech), 0.1 ul of ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix (1:106 diluted, ThermoFisher)).

RT mix (0.06 ul of 1M MgCl2, 2 ul of 2M Betaine, 0.1 ul of Biotin-TSO-LNA oligo, 0.25 ul of Rnase Inhibitor, 2 ul of 5* Maxima H- RT buffer, 0.1 ul of Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher), 1.39 ul of H2O) was added to each well, and the samples were subjected to reverse transcription. The cDNAs were subsequently amplified with PCR mix (12.5 ul 2* KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA), 0.25 ul of 10 uM Biotin-ISPCR oligo, 2.25 ul of H2O). The amplified cDNAs were then purified, tagmentated by in-house Tn5 (Picelli et al., 2014) and subsequently amplified using Nextera i5 and i7 Adapters (Illumina). The yielding libraries are purified, pooled and subjected to sequence in Nextseq-500 (Illumina).  FastQ files containing paired-end sequenced tags (reads) each cell were trimmed and filtered using prinseq 0.20.3 (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) with the parameters “-custom_params 'A 70%;T 70%;G 70%;C 70%'  -trim_tail_left 36  -trim_tail_right 36 -lc_method dust -lc_threshold 45 -min_gc 1 -out_format 3”  and cutadapt 1.5 (Martin, 2011) with the parameters “-q 15 --stringency 3 -e 0.05 --length 36”. The retained tags were evaluated using FastQC v0.11.2 and aligned to the Ensembl 84 gene annotation of the NCBI38/mm10 mouse genome using STAR 2.4.0g (Dobin et al., 2013) with the parameters “--runThreadN 4 --outReadsUnmapped Fastx --runMode alignReads --genomeDir $genomedir --outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.20 --outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.20 --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted SortedByCoordinate\\"". Number of tags per gene were calculated using htseq-count 0.6.0 (Anders et al., 2015) with the parameters “htseq-count -m intersection-nonempty -s no -a 10 -t exon -i gene_id”. For each gene, expression estimates per gene were expressed as log-transformed counts per million (log_cpm), by dividing total tags per gene by the total number of gene-aligned reads per cell and taking the log(x+1) of this value. Genes with a count per million (cpm) greater than 2 at least 2 samples were retained and raw counts were then normalized using mean-variance modeling at the observational level, as implemented in the voom() function in limma_3.30.4 (Ritchie et al., 2015), and additionally ComBat to correct for batch effects between the two biological replicates in the single-cell samples.",224
225,"Human cone photoreceptors represent a rare cell population of the human retina and are largely outnumbered by other retinal cell types. Despite their rarity, cone photoreceptors are critical for optimal daylight vision and their loss has the greatest impact on sight during the progression of retinal dystrophies. This is most applicable to the L/M-opsin cone populations which form the largest proportion of cones in the human retina and are the only cone types present within the fovea, which is responsible for fine detailed vision. Better understanding of the early genesis of these cells within the human developing retina, particularly in relation to the expression of genes that could be involved in regulating early events such as cell fate decision, is required. These molecular determinants could be exploited in vitro to generate more cone photoreceptors within human stem cell-derived retinal differentiation culture systems, suitable for use in cell transpantation therapies or disease modelling purposes. Additionally, the nature of this cell population in terms of their gene expression heterogeneity remains to be defined.  State of the art technology has now advanced so that mRNA sequencing can be performed on individual cells, which means the transcriptome of rare cell populations such as cone photoreceptor cells can be interrogated without the need for ample material. Using the AAV2/9 pR2.1:GFP reporter, containing a synthetic promoter region previously characterised to drive expression in cone photoreceptors, we label and isolate human foetal L/M-opsin cone photoreceptors within the 15pcw human retinal retina. Isolated GFP+ cells were separated into individual cells using the Fluidigm C1 microfludics system, before RNA extraction and cDNA library preparation was performed. In total, 74 single cells were captured and processed for RNA sequencing; quality control of the data led to the inclusion of 65 individual cells for the downstream analysis. Principal component analysis revealed a very subtle heterogeneity across the cells, with the highest variability observed according to the first principal component (PC1). Differential gene expression analysis correlated to PC1 led to the identification of 503 significantly differentially expressed genes. Notably, some genes increase in expression across the cells when ordered according to PC1 which have previous associations with photoreceptor maturation, whereas other genes associated with developmental processes became downregulated across the cells. This led to the hypothesis that at this single timepoint in the human foetal retina, developing L/M-opsin cone photoreceptors exist at different stages of maturation. Overlapping genes were identified from comparing RNA seq data from 15pcw single cells and population samples at early and late timepoints of pR2.1:GFP+ cells, which showed the same gene expression trend between experiments. This suggests differences in cell maturation at a single timepoint of development could be representative of their true developmental trajectory. This overlapping gene dataset is also highly useful to define new gene that could be involved in cone photoreceptor development.","Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq500 system with a targeted sequencing depth of 2million 75bp paired end per sample.Single cells are separated into chambers of IFC by Fluidigm C1 system via microfluidics, before cell lysis and RNA amplification is performed. Cell harvest is collected and processed for sequencing.AAV2/9.pR2.1:GFP production and application: 293T cells were cultured in D10 medium containing DMEM+Glutamax, 10% (v/w) FBS and 1x pencillin/streptomycin in 150cm plates and grown to 80% confluency. pd10/pR2.1.L/Mopsin-eGFP construct, pHGT1 helper vector, AAV2/9 caspid were transfected into 293T cells using polyethylenimine (PEI), before harvesting cells after 72 hours and performing four thaw-vortex-freeze cycles for viral release. pR2.1.L/M-opsin promoter was originally generated by the Jeremy Nathans group (Wang et al., 1992). Virus lysate underwent benzonase treatment and was prepared for purification through multiple centrifugation steps and sequential filtering with 5m, 0.45m and 0.22m PES membranes. Virus was purified via ion exchange chromatography using AKTA Prime (GE Life Sciences) and concentrated using a Vivaspin 4 concentrator (Vivaproducts). Viral genomic titer was determined through qRT PCR and the virus titer used in this study ranged from 1.48x1013-1.01x1014. Virus was added to the human foetal retinal explant at a MOI of 40,000-45,000 through addition to culture media. Human foetal explant was cultured for 7 days to allow for pR2.1:GFP expression to be visualised. On day 7, human foetal retinal explant was dissociated enzymatically into a single cell suspension using the papain dissociation system (Worthington Biochemical, Lorne Laboratories) following manufacturers protocol. The 15pcw foetal retinal sample was cut into smaller pieces (5mm x 5mm) before the addition of papain (approx. 100l per piece). 70m cell strainers were used to ensure cell single density of cell suspension. For GFP cell isolation, cells were resuspended in a final volume of 500l blocking solution (1% (w/v) BSA in PBS). The FACSAria III Cell Sorter and the MoFlo XDP Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) were used to isolate GFP+ cells. Cell populations (GFP+ and GFP-) were collected into eppendorf tubes containing 500l of 50% v/v FBS (DMEM). After sorting, cell populations were collected via centrifugation for 20 minutes at 200 x g; the supernatant was subsequently removed and RNA extraction was performed on cell pellets.Cell harvests were subject to the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Clontech Laboratories) and cDNA libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina).Human foetal eyes were obtained from the Joint Medical Research Council UK (grant # G0700089)/Wellcome Trust (grant # GR082557) Human Developmental Biology Resource (http://www.hdbr.org/)",225
226,"Circulating tumour cells in women with advanced oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer acquire a HER2-positive subpopulation after multiple courses of therapy. In contrast to HER2-amplified primary breast cancer, which is highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy, the clinical significance of acquired HER2 heterogeneity during the evolution of metastatic breast cancer is unknown. Here we analyse circulating tumour cells from 19 women with ER+/HER2- primary tumours, 84% of whom had acquired circulating tumour cells expressing HER2. Cultured circulating tumour cells maintain discrete HER2+ and HER2- subpopulations: HER2+ circulating tumour cells are more proliferative but not addicted to HER2, consistent with activation of multiple signalling pathways; HER2- circulating tumour cells show activation of Notch and DNA damage pathways, exhibiting resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy, but sensitivity to Notch inhibition. HER2+ and HER2- circulating tumour cells interconvert spontaneously, with cells of one phenotype producing daughters of the opposite within four cell doublings. Although HER2+ and HER2- circulating tumour cells have comparable tumour initiating potential, differential proliferation favours the HER2+ state, while oxidative stress or cytotoxic chemotherapy enhances transition to the HER2- phenotype. Simultaneous treatment with paclitaxel and Notch inhibitors achieves sustained suppression of tumorigenesis in orthotopic circulating tumour cell-derived tumour models. Together, these results point to distinct yet interconverting phenotypes within patient-derived circulating tumour cells, contributing to progression of breast cancer and acquisition of drug resistance. Seventy-four single candidate CTCs from two representative ER+/HER2- patients (BRx-42 and BRx-82) and 14 triple negative patients were isolated via micromanipulation and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. Thirteen candidate CTCs expressed PTPRC at a level higher than 10 reads-per-million, so were deemed potential White Blood Cells and therefore dropped from further consideration. Expression profiles of CTCs expressing ERBB2 at a level greater than 10 RPM were compared with those expressing ERBB2 at a level less than 10 RPM.","Patients with a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer provided informed consent for de-identified blood collection, as per Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol (DF/HCC 05-300).Single CTCs were isolated from fresh whole blood following leukocyte depletion using the microfluidic CTC-iChip as described in PMID 23552373. Single cells were individually micromanipulated using a 10 um transfer tip on an Eppendorf TransferMan NK 2 micromanipulator, transferred into PCR tubes containing RNA protective lysis buffer, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.We used the Clontech SMARTer Ultra Low Input Kit for RNA v3 for cDNA synthesis.

Cell lysis buffer was prepared by adding 1 lRNase inhibitor (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to 19 lTriton X-100 solution (0.2% v/v). Cells were sorted directly into tube containing 2 ul lysis buffer, 1 ul dNTP mix (10mM) and 1 ul oligo-dT primer at 5 M. Tubes were stored at -80 C until needed. Reverse-transcription and PCR amplification were performed as described with the exception of reducing the IS PCR primer to a 50 nM final concentration and increasing the number of cycles to 28. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina; San Diego, CA, USA) and sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq sequencing platforms.PBMC were separated from freshly collected whole blood by density gradient centrifugation, before 4  10^5 cells per well were cultured in medium (AIM-V with 1% Glutamax, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated human AB serum (Sigma, USA) in 96-well U-bottomed plates in presence of 10 g ml 1 of the CINGVCWTV peptide (aa 10731081 of HCV non-structural 3 protein). For the initial culture, the cytokines, IL-7 (10 ng ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec), IL-12 (300 g ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec) and IL-15 (10 ng ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec) were added. Fresh AIM-V media and IL-2 (20 U ml 1, Miltenyi Biotec) was added to the wells on days 4 and 7 post-stimulation. On day 10 post-stimulation, cells were re-stimulated with irradiated autologous monocytes supplemented with IL-2, IL-7, IL-12 and IL-15 in same concentrations as stated for day 1. On day 14 and 17 fresh AIM-V media containing IL-2 (U ml 1) was added to the wells. The established cell line was harvested at day 20 and cryopreserved in RPMI with 20% DMSO. Re-stimulation of the cell line was performed with 10 g ml 1 of the CINGVCWTV peptide per well (2 x 10^5 cells in each well) for 24 h.

228,"Polyploidy provides new genetic material that facilitates evolutionary novelty, species adaptation, and crop domestication. Polyploidy often leads to an increase in cell or organism size, which may affect transcript abundance or transcriptome size, but the relationship between polyploidy and transcriptome changes remains poorly understood.

230,"Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms infecting hundreds of millions of people. These parasites alternate between asexual reproduction in molluscan intermediate hosts and sexual reproduction in mammalian definitive hosts. Thriving in such disparate environments requires remarkable developmental plasticity, manifested by five different body plans deployed throughout the life cycle. Stem cells found in both larval and adult schistosomes provide a potential cellular source for this plasticity. To understand the relationships between stem cells from different life-cycle stages, we used single-cell transcriptional profiling. We identified four stem cell classes and validated their distinct spatiotemporal patterns using in situ hybridization. Characterizing these cells at major developmental transitions revealed larvally derived stem cells that are passed to the intramammalian stage; distinct subsets of these cells appear to be the source of either adult somatic stem cells or the germline. This work demonstrates that stem cell heterogeneity drives the propagation of the schistosome life cycle.","In vitro-transformed mother sporocysts were obtained as detailed previously (Wang et al, 2013; Mann et al, 2010; Ivanchenko et al, 1999). Briefly, S. mansoni (strain NMRI) eggs were purified from livers harvested from schistosome-infected mice (Swiss Webster, female, 7 weeks post-infection). Free-swimming miracidia were hatched from eggs in artificial pond water and transformed in vitro to mother sporocysts by exchanging pond water with sporocyst culture medium supplemented with 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco) and 20 ug/mL gentamycin (Gemini) at 37C in 5% CO2 - 5% O2 for 48 hr.Single stem cells from in vitro-transformed mother sporocysts were captured on a medium-sized (10–17 um) microfluidic RNA-seq chip (Fluidigm) using the Fluidigm C1 system. Sorted cells were resuspended at a density of 300 cells/uL, with size distribution and number density confirmed on a TC20 cell counter (Bio-rad). The single-cell suspension was then mixed with Fluidigm suspension reagent at 7:3 ratio and loaded onto the chip immediately. After capture, chambers on the chip were examined quickly by phase-contrast microscopy to assess the number, size, and morphology of captured cells and by fluorescence microscopy to examine the live-dead cell stain, and only chambers containing single round-shaped live cells were included in the downstream procedures.cDNAs were prepared on the chip using SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit for Illumina (Clontech) following the manufacturers instructions.

268,"During mammalian organogenesis, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most major internal and external organs. The key regulators of developmental defects can be studied during this crucial period, but conventional approaches lack the throughput and resolution to obtain a global view of the molecular states and trajectories of a rapidly diversifying and expanding number of cell types. Here we set out to investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse development during organogenesis at single cell resolution. With an improved single cell combinatorial indexing-based protocol (‘sci-RNA-seq3’), we profiled over 2 million cells derived from 61 mouse embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation (E9.5 to E13.5; 10 to 15 replicates per timepoint). We identify hundreds of expanding, contracting and transient cell types, many of which are only detected because of the depth of cellular coverage obtained here, and define the corresponding sets of cell type-specific marker genes, several of which we validate by whole mount in situ hybridization. We explore the dynamics of proliferation and gene expression within cell types over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle. With a new algorithm (Monocle 3), we identify the major single cell developmental trajectories of mouse organogenesis, and within these discover examples of distinct paths to the same endpoint, i.e. branching and convergence.

281,"For the three cell lines, cells were dissociated into single cell suspensions in FACS buffer and sorted for 9-cell-mixture and single cell experiment (see below for sorting strategy). The remaining cells were centrifuged and frozen at -80C for later RNA extraction. The RNA was then extracted using a Qiagen RNA miniprep kit. The amount of RNA was quantified using both Invitrogen Qubit fluorometric quantitation and an Agilent 4200 bioanalyzer to get an accurate estimation. The extracted RNA was then diluted to 60 ng\ul and then mixed in different proportions, according to the study design. The different mixtures were further diluted to create an RNA series that ranged from 3.75pg to 30pg that was dispensed into CEL-seq2 and SORT-seq primer plates using a Nanodrop II dispenser. Prepared RNA mixture plates were sealed and immediately frozen upside down at -80C.
For CEL-seq2, Single cells were flow sorted into chilled 384-well PCR plates containing 1.2ul of primer/ERCC mix using a BD FACSAria III flow cytometer. Sorted plates were sealed and immediately frozen upside down at -80C. Then these plates, together with the mRNA mixture plates, were taken from -80C and processed using an adapted Cel-Seq2 protocol with the following variations. The second strand synthesis was performed using NEBNext Second Strand Synthesis module in a final reaction volume of 8 ul and NucleoMag NGS Clean-up and Size select magnetic beads were used for all DNA purification and size selection steps. For the 9-cell-mixture plates, clean up of the PCR product was performed with 2X0.7-0.9 bead/DNA ratio. For the single cell and mRNA mixture plates, two different clean up ratios for the PCR product were used (0.8 followed by 0.9). The choice of clean-up ratio was optimized from the QC results of the 9-cell-mixture data and the SORT-seq protocols.",,278

290,"We systematically and directly compared seven single cell RNA-sequencing methods, including two low-throughput plate-based methods (Smart-seq2 and CEL-Seq2) and five high-throughput methods (10x Chromium (v2, v3), Drop-seq, Seq-Well, inDrops, and sci-RNA-seq), producing expression profiles from ~92,000 cells (nuclei) overall.  We tested three sample types – a mixture of human and mouse cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and mouse cortex, each sample with two replicates – to generate a total of 36 different single cell RNA-sequencing libraries.  For mouse cortex, we tested four single nucleus RNA-sequencing methods (Smart-seq2, 10x Chromium (v2), DroNc-seq, and sci-RNA-seq).  We tested each sample type in two experiments (Mixture1 and Mixture2, PBMC1 and PBMC2, Cortex1 and Cortex2) run on different days to assess reproducibility.  In each comparison experiment, we started with one sample with processing of aliquots starting at the same time for each method.  The only exceptions were for Seq-Well in PBMC1, in which we thawed an identical PBMC aliquot a second time to obtain a Seq-Well dataset with sufficient cells profiled for PBMCs, and for 10x Chromium in PBMC1, in which we thawed an identical aliquot to directly compare version 2 (v2) with version 3 (v3).  In each experiment, we aimed to collect data from ~350 cells for the low-throughput methods and ~3,000 cells for the high-throughput methods.  In each experiment, we also used an aliquot of cells to generate a bulk RNA-sequencing library as a control.  We sequenced all libraries together in an attempt to avoid batch effects due to varying sequence quality among Illumina flowcell lanes, with the following exceptions.  We sequenced the inDrops libraries separately because they have an opposite read structure from those generated with the other methods.  We performed additional sequencing for some libraries in an attempt to sequence similar numbers of reads per cell for each low or high throughput method.  We aimed for 50,000 to 100,000 reads per cell for high-throughput methods and 750,000 to 1,000,000 reads per cell for low-throughput methods.  The scRNA-seq FASTQ files are named with sample names, Illumina flowcell lanes, and library preparing methods.  Different fields are separated by dots (.), for example, PBMC2.CC86JANXX.011818-DropSeq.unmapped.1.fastq.gz, where PBMC2 is the sample name (can be Mixture1, Mixture2, PBMC1, PBMC2, Cortex1, and Cortex2), CC86JANXX is the flowcell lanes, 011818 is the library preparation date, and DropSeq is the RNA-seq method (Drop-seq in this case, can be SM2, CELseq, 10X, DropSeq, DroNcSeq, SeqWell, inDrops, and SciSeq).  This FASTQ file (read 1) includes cell barcodes and UMI information.  The corresponding cDNA reads are in PBMC2.CC86JANXX.011818-DropSeq.unmapped.2.fastq.gz (read2).  For more information about the structures of reads from different protocols, please see Supplementary Table 11 of the manuscript.  FASTQ files with the same sample name and library preparation method but different flowcell lanes are from the same library but sequenced at different times, e.g., PBMC2.CCLBDANXX.68.011818-DropSeq.unmapped.1.fastq.gz.  Therefore, these FASTQ files can be merged together for analyses.  For 10x Chromium data, the reads from the same library are split into four files (10X_A, 10X_B, 10X_C, and 10X_D) and the reads from these files can also be merged together.",,287
