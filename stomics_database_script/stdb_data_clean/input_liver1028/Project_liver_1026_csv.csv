PRO000000291,liver_paper,GSE168933,Liver stromal cells restrict macrophage maturation and stromal IL-6 limits the differentiation of cirrhosis-linked macrophages,"Background & aims: Myeloid cells are key regulators of cirrhosis, a major cause of mortality worldwide. Because stromal cells can modulate the functionality of myeloid cells in vitro, targeting stromal-myeloid interactions has become an attractive potential therapeutic strategy. We aimed to investigate how human liver stromal cells impact myeloid cell properties and to understand the utility of a stromal-myeloid coculture system to study these interactions in the context of cirrhosis.Methods: Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of non-cirrhotic (n = 7) and cirrhotic (n = 5) human liver tissue were correlated to the bulk RNA-sequencing results of in vitro cocultured human CD14+ and primary liver stromal cells. Complimentary mechanistic experiments and flow cytometric analysis were performed on human liver stromal-myeloid coculture systems.Results: We found that stromal-myeloid coculture reduces the frequency CD14+ cell subsets transcriptionally similar to liver macrophages, showing that stromal cells inhibit the maturation of monocytes into macrophages. Stromal cells also influenced in vitro macrophage differentiation by skewing away from cirrhosis-linked CD9+ scar-associated macrophage-like cells and towards CD163+ Kupffer cell-like macrophages. We identify IL-6 production as a mechanism by which stromal cells limit CD9+ macrophage differentiation and find that local IL-6 levels are decreased in early-stage human liver disease compared to healthy liver tissue, suggesting a protective role for local IL-6 in the healthy liver.Conclusions: Our work reveals an unanticipated role for liver stromal cells in impeding the maturation and altering the differentiation of macrophages and should prompt investigations into the role of local IL-6 production in the pathogenesis of liver disease. These studies provide a framework for investigating macrophage-stromal interactions during cirrhosis.Lay summary: The impact of human liver stromal cells on myeloid cell maturation and differentiation in liver disease is incompletely understood.

Thereby, we uncovered the landscape of portal mesenchymal cells in homeostatic mouse liver. Trajectory analysis enabled inferring a small cell population further defined by surface markers used to isolate it. This population consisted of portal fibroblasts with mesenchymal stem cell features (PMSCs), i.e., high clonogenicity and trilineage differentiation potential, that generated proliferative myofibroblasts, contrasting with nonproliferative HSC-derived myofibroblasts (-MF).

We integrated 178,651 MNPs from 13 tissues across 41 datasets to generate a MNP single-cell RNA compendium (MNP-VERSE), a publicly available tool to map MNPs and define conserved gene signatures of MNP populations. Next, we generated a MoMac-focused compendium that revealed an array of specialized cell subsets widely distributed across multiple tissues. Specific pathological forms were expanded in cancer and inflammation. All neoplastic tissues contained conserved tumor-associated macrophage populations. In particular, we focused on IL4I1+CD274(PD-L1)+IDO1+ macrophages, which accumulated in the tumor periphery in a T cell-dependent manner via interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and CD40/CD40L-induced maturation from IFN-primed monocytes. IL4I1_Macs exhibited immunosuppressive characteristics through tryptophan degradation and promoted the entry of regulatory T cell into tumors.

Herein, we aimed to define the molecular characteristics of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes with a special focus on CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs).Methods: We used high-dimensional single-cell technologies to characterize the T-cell and myeloid compartments of iCCA tissues, comparing these with their tumor-free peritumoral and circulating counterparts. We further used genomics and cellular assays to define the iCCA-specific role of a novel transcription factor, mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1), in Treg biology.Results: We found poor infiltration of putative tumor-specific CD39+ CD8+ T cells accompanied by abundant infiltration of hyperactivated CD4+ Tregs. Single-cell RNA-sequencing identified an altered network of transcription factors in iCCA-infiltrating compared to peritumoral T cells, suggesting reduced effector functions by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and enhanced immunosuppression by CD4+ Tregs. Specifically, we found that expression of MEOX1 was highly enriched in tumor-infiltrating Tregs, and demonstrated that MEOX1 overexpression is sufficient to reprogram circulating Tregs to acquire the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Accordingly, enrichment of the MEOX1-dependent gene program in Tregs was strongly associated with poor prognosis in a large cohort of patients with iCCA.Conclusions: We observed abundant infiltration of hyperactivated CD4+ Tregs in iCCA tumors along with reduced CD8+ T-cell effector functions. Interfering with hyperactivated Tregs should be explored as an approach to enhance antitumor immunity in iCCA.Lay summary: Immune cells have the potential to slow or halt the progression of tumors.

Our data detail divergence of vascular and sinusoidal endothelia, including a distinct transcriptional profile for sinusoidal endothelial specification by E8.75. We characterize two distinct mesothelial cell types as well as early hepatic stellate cells and reveal distinct spatiotemporal distributions for these populations. We capture transcriptional profiles for hepatoblast specification and migration, including the emergence of a hepatomesenchymal cell type and evidence for hepatoblast collective cell migration.

To circumvent these issues, we analyzed 45,334 single-cell transcriptomes from embryonic day (E)7.5, when endoderm progenitors are specified, to E10.5 liver, when liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell lineages emerge. Our data detail divergence of vascular and sinusoidal endothelia, including a distinct transcriptional profile for sinusoidal endothelial specification by E8.75. We characterize two distinct mesothelial cell types as well as early hepatic stellate cells and reveal distinct spatiotemporal distributions for these populations. We capture transcriptional profiles for hepatoblast specification and migration, including the emergence of a hepatomesenchymal cell type and evidence for hepatoblast collective cell migration. Further, we identify cell-cell interactions during the organization of the primitive sinusoid.

PRO000000307,liver_paper,CNP0000650,Single-cell landscape of the ecosystem in early-relapse hepatocellular  carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high relapse and low 5-year survival rates.  Single-cell profiling in relapsed HCC may aid in the design of effective  anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. We profiled the transcriptomes  of ∼17,000 cells from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC cases. Early-relapse  tumors have reduced levels of regulatory T cells, increased dendritic cells  (DCs), and increased infiltrated CD8+ T cells, compared with primary tumors, in  two independent cohorts. Remarkably, CD8+ T cells in recurrent tumors  overexpressed KLRB1 (CD161) and displayed an innate-like low cytotoxic state,  with low clonal expansion, unlike the classical exhausted state observed in  primary HCC. The enrichment of these cells was associated with a worse  prognosis. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed  potential immune evasion mechanisms in recurrent tumor cells that dampen DC  antigen presentation and recruit innate-like CD8+ T cells. Our comprehensive  picture of the HCC ecosystem provides deeper insights into immune evasion  mechanisms associated with tumor relapse.",,cancer,CNP0000650,,,Single-cell landscape of the ecosystem in early-relapse hepatocellular  carcinoma,Cell,10.1016/j.cell.2020.11.041,33357445,"Yunfan Sun,Liang Wu,Yu Zhong,Kaiqian Zhou,Yong Hou,Zifei Wang,Zefan Zhang,Jiarui Xie,Chunqing Wang,Dandan Chen,Yaling Huang,Xiaochan Wei,Yinghong Shi,Zhikun Zhao,Yuehua Li,Ziwei Guo,Qichao Yu,Liqin Xu,Giacomo Volpe,Shuangjian Qiu,Jian Zhou,Carl Ward,Huichuan Sun,Ye Yin,Xun Xu,Xiangdong Wang,Miguel A.
