294,Primary liver samples from 5 patients were used for single cell RNA sequencing by 10X Genomics,"The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is critical for metabolic and immune functions. However, surprisingly little is known about the cells that make up the human liver and its immune microenvironment. To address this, we mapped the cellular landscape in the human liver using single cell RNA sequencing. We carefully fractionated fragile, fresh hepatic tissue from human livers to obtain viable parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Our single cell transcriptomics map reveals 20 discrete cell populations, including a novel description of distinct monocyte/ macrophage populations in the human liver. We present a comprehensive view of the human liver at single cell resolution that outlines new characteristics of resident cells in the liver, and in particular provides a new map of the human hepatic immune microenvironment.",289

296,Human liver tissue were disaggregated and profiled using the Chromium Single Cell 3 Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 (10X Genomics) .In vitro human stromal-myeloid coculture systems,"Liver disease is the cause of approximately two million deaths globally per year, yet effective therapies are lacking. Iterative tissue injury leads to prolonged inflammation, extensive fibrosis, and the possible progression to deadly chronic-end stage disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study we investigated the ability of liver stromal cells to effect macrophage maturation and differentiation by using an in vitro human stromal-myeloid coculture systems and single cell RNA sequencing.",291
297,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure, but little is known about its pathophysiology. Here, we generated single-cell atlases of 23 lung, 16 kidney, 15 liver and 18 heart COVID-19 autopsy donor tissue samples, and spatial atlases of 14 lung donors. Integrated computational analysis uncovered substantial remodeling in the lung epithelial, immune and stromal compartments, with evidence of multiple paths of failed tissue regeneration, including defective alveolar type 2 differentiation and expansion of myofibroblasts and putative TP63+ intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor cells. Viral RNAs were enriched in mononuclear phagocytic and endothelial lung cells which induced specific host programs. Spatial analysis in lung distinguished inflammatory host responses in lung regions with and without viral RNA. Analysis of the other tissue atlases showed transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types in COVID-19 donor heart tissue, and mapped cell types and genes implicated with disease severity based on COVID-19 GWAS. Our foundational dataset elucidates the biological impact of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection across the body a key step towards new treatments.","We developed a large cross-body COVID-19 autopsy biobank of 420 autopsy specimens, spanning 11 organs and 17 donors and used it to generate a single cell atlas of COVID-19 lung, kidney, liver and heart from up to 16 donors, and a lung spatial atlas. For our single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq data, we provide both Cellranger raw counts matrices and counts matrices following ambient and emtpy drop removal using Cellbender remove-background for all lung, heart, liver, and kidney samples included in our published atlases as well as for a some airway and lymph node samples that we generated data for but did not analyze or include in our publication. We provide a metadata file including a list of barcodes that passed QC, basic QC metrics, and annotations for the lung, heart, liver, and kidney atlases. We provide an RSEM countsmatrix for our bulk RNA-sequencing samples, including data for the lung samples we analyzed and included in our publication as well as one heart and one brain sample that we did not include in our publication.",292
298,"Hepatic cells were isolated from wildtype C57BL/6 livers, at postnatal day 1, 3, 7, 21 and 56 (indicated by D1, D3, D7, D21, and D56, respectively).","The liver is the largest metabolic organ in mammals to process most nutrients and cellular wastes, although its development and maturation in postnatal life is unclear. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis focusing on postnatal development and maturation of murine liver. A total of 52,834 single cell transcriptomes, collected from the newborn to adult livers, were analyzed. We observed dramatic changes in cellular compositions during liver postnatal development. We characterized the process of hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cell zonation establishment at single cell resolution. Furthermore, trajectory and gene regulatory analyses showed development of circadian clock in early liver as well as response of several critical metabolic pathways in order to adapt to the abrupt environmental changes at birth and in the postnatal life. Finally, we identified a special type of macrophages, enriched at postnatal day 7, with hybrid phenotype of both macrophage and endothelial cells. Cell-cell interaction analysis indicated this group of cells involved in regulation of liver sinusoidal vascularization and Treg cell activity. This study provides a comprehensive blueprint for further dissection of liver functions and diseases.",293
299,"Five patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital were incorporated into the current study, including two intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), two gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) and one dCCA patients. Of note, none of the patients have undergone any preoperative treatments (chemotherapy, radiation or anti-tumor medicines) prior to tumor resection. Tumor primary locus and metastasis as well as lymph node were consistently harvested for each participant, if available. Meanwhile, peripheral blood samples were collected prior to surgical procedures using anticoagulant tubes.","Immunotherapies have been explored in treating solid tumors, albeit with disparate clinical effects in distinct cancer types. Systematic interrogation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is vital to the prediction of immunotherapy response and the development of innovative immunotherapeutics. To comprehensively characterize the immune microenvironment in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing in unselected viable cells from 16 matched samples. We identified nineteen cell subsets from a total of 45,851 cells, in which exhausted CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) in BTC were shown to augment and communicate within the TME. Transcriptional profiles coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequences revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells retained clonal expansion and high proliferation in the TME, and some of them highly expressed the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) sensor XBP1, indicating its key role in remodeling TME. Functional assays demonstrated that XBP1 and common immune checkpoints (PD1, TIGIT) were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells cocultured within the TME of BTC cell lines (GBC-SD, HCCC-9810). When treating the coculture groups with the specific inhibitor of IRE1Î±-XBP1 (4Î¼8C), the downregulation of TIGIT was observed in the treatment group. Collectively, comprehensive transcriptome profiling provides deeper insights into the immune atlas in advanced BTC, which might be instrumental in exploring novel immunotherapy strategies.",294

301,"Systematic interrogation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is key to the development of immunotherapies and the prediction of their clinical responses in cancers. Here, we perform deep single-cell RNA sequencing on single T cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor and adjacent normal tissues from hepatocellular carcinoma patients.","T cells from HCC patients were sorted, profiled by Smart-seq2 and Tang2010 protocol (for patient P1202, the suffix ""t"" indicate cells from this patient were processed using Tang2010 protocol; cells from other patients were processed using SMART-Seq2) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 and HiSeq4000. Based on FACS analysis, single cells of different subtypes, including CD8+ T cells (CD3+ and CD8+), T helper cells (CD3+, CD4+ and CD25-), and regulatory T cells (CD3+, CD4+ and CD25high) were sorted to perform RNA sequencing. The categories £¨""sampleType"" column in the SAMPLES section£© contain PTC(CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood), NTC(CD8+ T cells from adjacent normal liver tissues) ,TTC (CD8+ T cells from tumor), PTH(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25- T cells from peripheral blood), NTH(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25- T cells from adjacent normal liver tissues), TTH(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25- T cells from tumor), PTR(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25high T cells from peripheral blood), NTR(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25high T cells from adjacent normal liver tissues), TTR(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25high T cells from tumor), JTH(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25- T cells from joint area between the tumor and the adjacent normal tissue),JTR(CD3+, CD4+ and CD25high T cells from joint area between the tumor and the adjacent normal tissue), JTC(CD3+CD8+ T cells from joint area between the tumor and the adjacent normal tissue)",296
302,"Indexed single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) of human dendritic cells and monocytes from Blood, Liver, Lung, Spleen and Tonsil.","Mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) encompass dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages (MoMac), which exhibit antimicrobial, homeostatic and immunoregulatory functions. We integrated 178,651 MNP from 13 tissues across 41 datasets to generate a MNP single-cell RNA compendium (MNP-VERSE), a publicly available tool to map MNPs and defined conserved gene signatures of MNP populations. Next, we generated a MoMac-focused compendium that revealed an array of specialised cell subsets widely distributed across multiple tissues. Specific pathological forms were expanded in cancer and inflammation. All neoplastic tissues contained conserved tumour-associated macrophage populations. Particularly, we focused on IL4I1+CD274(PD-L1)+IDO1+ macrophages, which accumulated in the tumour periphery in a T cell-dependent manner via IFNg and CD40/CD40L-induced maturation from interferon-primed monocytes. IL4I1_Macs exhibited immune-suppressive characteristics through tryptophan degradation and promoted entry of regulatory T cell into tumours. This integrated analysis provides a robust online-available platform for uniform annotation and dissection of specific macrophage functions in healthy and pathological states.",297
303,Liver tissue and PBMC samples from 6 patients with HCC. 1 additional tissue sample for 10x Genomics WTA analysis.,"Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a typical inflammation-associated cancer. Tissue resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have been suggested to control tumor surveillance. Here we studied how the local cytokine milieu controls ILCs in HCC. Design: We performed bulk RNA sequencing of HCC tissue as well as flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of enriched ILCs from non-tumor liver, margin and tumor core derived from 48 HCC patients. Simultaneous measurement of protein and RNA expression at the single-cell level (AbSeq) identified precise signatures of ILC subgroups. In-vitro culturing of ILCs was used to validate findings from in-silico analysis. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data from large HCC cohorts allowed stratification and survival analysis based on transcriptomic signatures. Results: RNA sequencing of tumor, non-tumor and margin identified tumor-dependent gradients of which were not only associated with poor survival but also control ILC plasticity. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry of ILCs from HCC livers identified NK-like cells in the non-tumor tissue, losing their cytotoxic profile as they transitioned into tumor ILC1 and NK-like-ILC3 cells. Tumor ILC composition was mediated by cytokine gradients that directed ILC plasticity towards activated tumor ILC2s. This was liver-specific and not seen in ILCs from PBMC. Patients with high ILC2/ILC1 ratio expressed IL-33 in the tumor that promoted ILC2 generation which was associated with better survival. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the tumor cytokine milieu controls ILC composition and HCC outcome. Specific changes of cytokines modify ILC composition in the tumor by inducing plasticity and alter ILC function.",298
304,"To investigate the functional effects of nizatidine on liver immune cells, we isolated CD45+ leucocytes from liver tissues of patients with advanced liver disease and HCC and treated the immune cell population with nizatidine or vehicle control. We then analyzed the effect of the compound by scRNA-Seq.",scRNA-Seq was performed by Single-Cell Discoveries B.V. using SORT-seq protocol.,299
305,We performed bulk RNA sequencing of DMSO differentiated Huh751 at different time points,"Abstract: Chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are life-threatening with limited treatment options. The lack of clinically relevant/tractable experimental models hampers therapeutic discovery. We developed a simple and robust human liver cell-based system modeling a clinical prognostic liver signature (PLS) predicting long-term liver disease progression toward HCC. Using the PLS as a readout, followed by validation in NASH-HCC animal models and patient-derived tumorspheroids, we identified nizatidine, a histamine receptor H2 (HRH2) blocker, for treatment of advanced liver disease and HCC chemoprevention. Perturbation studies combined with scRNA-Seq analyses of patient liver tissues uncovered HRH2+, CLEC5Ahigh, MARCOlow liver macrophages and hepatocytes as nizatidine targets. The PLS model combined with scRNA-Seq of patient tissues enables discovery of urgently needed targets and therapeutics for treatment of advanced liver disease and cancer prevention.",299
306,"Single-cell transcriptomic data are presented from 5 healthy livers, 5 cirrhotic livers and 4 PBMC samples from cirrhotic patients. We also present single-cell transcriptomic data on hepatic macrophages from healthy mice or mice following chronic carbon tetrachloride administration.","We profile the transcriptomes of over 100,000 human single cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types present in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. We uncover a novel scar-associated TREM2+CD9+ macrophage subpopulation, which expands in liver fibrosis, differentiates from circulating monocytes, has a corollary population in mouse liver fibrosis and is pro-fibrogenic. We also define novel ACKR1+ and PLVAP+ endothelial cells which expand in cirrhosis, are topographically scar-restricted and enhance leucocyte transmigration. Multi-lineage ligand-receptor modelling of interactions between the novel scar-associated macrophages, endothelial cells and PDGFRÎ±+ collagen-producing mesenchymal cells reveals intra-scar activity of several pro-fibrogenic pathways including TNFRSF12A, PDGFR and NOTCH signalling. Our work dissects unanticipated aspects of the cellular and molecular basis of human organ fibrosis at a single-cell level, and provides the conceptual framework required to discover rational therapeutic targets in liver cirrhosis.",299
307,"The liver plays a critical role in both immune defense and tolerance in the body. The liver-resident immune cells (LrICs) determine the immune properties, but the unique composition and heterogeneity of these cells are incompletely understood. Here, we dissect the diversity of LrICs by a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling using the unbiased single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). A total of 70, 706 of CD45+ immune cells from the paired liver perfusion, spleen and peripheral blood as references were profiled. We identified 33 discrete cell populations comprising 14 of T and NK cell, 7 of B cell, 4 of antibody-secreting cell (ASC) and 8 of myeloid cell subsets in human liver and donor-paired spleen and blood, and characterized their tissue distribution, gene expression and functional modules. Especially, four of CXCR6+ T and NK cell subsets were found to be present preferentially in the liver, where they manifested heterogeneity, distinct function and prominent homeostatic proliferation. We propose a universal category system of T and NK cells based on distinct chemokine receptors, confirmed subsequently by phenotype, transcriptional factors and functionality. We also identified adaptive changes by the spleen and liver-resident monocyte and macrophage populations. Finally, we give a global glimpse on B cell and ASC subsets in human spleen and liver. We, therefore, reveal the heterogeneity and functional diversity of LrICs in human. This study presents comprehensively the landscape of LrICs and will enable further study on their roles in various human diseases.",Using 10x genomics to measure CD45+ immune cells in healthy human liver and paired spleen and PBMCs from the same donors access to liver transplantation.,300
308,A total of twelve samples; two conditions (normal and tumor) matched from six patients.,"In tumors, CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs), a specialized subtype of cells indispensable for maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, inhibit anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy. Selective targeting of the hyperactive Tregs promote tumor regression and synergizes with checkpoint blockade without severe, systemic autoimmunity, that is otherwise observed with non-specific Treg depletion. However, is poorly defined how Treg hyper-activation regulated in the tumor microenvironment. We found that mesenchyme homeobox-1 (MEOX1) a transcription factor with an important role in skeleton formation during development, is specifically overexpressed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma infiltrating Treg compared to Treg cells present in the peritumoral tissue. Integration of transcriptomic data revealed that MEOX1 positively regulates several molecules involved in immunosuppression, including CTLA-4, ICOS and IL10, as well as a tumor Treg-specific signature associated with disease progression. Thus, interfering with the MEOX1-dependent molecular program may represent a novel immunotherapeutic approach capable to block immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment without inducing autoimmunity in peripheral tissues.",301
309,"We sorted CD45+CD235a- hematopoietic cells using flow cytometry from human embryos at multiple Carnegie stages (CS11, CS12, CS13, CS15, CS17, CS20 and CS23) and sites (yolk sac, head, liver, blood, lung and skin), and then performed a modified single cell tagged reverse transcription (STRT) protocol.","Macrophages are the earliest emerging cells of the nascent immune system during embryonic development, and as innate immune cells constitutes an important first-line barrier against foreign organisms and pathogens. Rodent macrophages have been shown to infiltrate multiple organs at an early stage, developing symbiotically alongside these organs becoming tissue-resident macrophages (TRM) supporting tissue development and homeostasis. However, knowledge of the development and specialization of macrophages in the early human embryo is still limited. In order to study the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic process of macrophage development in the early human embryo, we applied single-cell transcriptomic sequencing to generate a map of all CD45+CD235a- hematopoietic cells in human embryos of successive developmental stages from Carnegie stage (CS) 11 to 23. Here, we unravelled for the first time a map of macrophage heterogeneity across multiple anatomical sites and identified multiple macrophage subsets in the early human embryo, including various types of embryonic TRM (head, liver, lung and skin), and traced their developmental trajectories from yolk sac/embryonic liver-derived macrophages to their TRM specification in the head and liver based on core transcriptional factors. Altogether, our analyses provide a comprehensive characterization of the spatial and temporal dynamics of macrophage development in the early human embryo, and provides a reference for future study into human TRM function and embryonic development.",302
310,We performed single cell RNA-seq analysis for CS11 and CS15 human yolk sacs.,"Yolk sac is an important site for early embryonic hematopoiesis. However, our understanding of early hematopoietic development is still very limited. Single cell transcriptome sequencing provides us with a good research method.

Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing using cells isolated from human hemogenic/hematopoietic sites such as aorto-gonad-mesonephros (AGM), liver, and thymic primordia spanning embryonic and fetal stages. The transcriptional atlas of thymic primordia illustrates the cellular trajectory of early T-lymphocyte development. Further, thymic seeding progenitors in liver and unique T lymphoid progenitors in AGM at CS14, are first unveiled. We also reveal the stepwise-specification of thymic epithelial cellsï¼Œand the potential cell-cell interactions between T-lymphocyte progenitors and stromal cells during thymus organogenesis.

326,Elaborating the tumor ecosystem of primary and relapsed hepatocellular carcinoma,"Liver cancer is one of the most malignant cancers in the world, and a relapse rate up to 60~70% after resection is a major factor contributing to a low 5-year survival rate (~15%). We generated more than 20,000 single-cell full-length transcriptomes profiles from 19 primary or relapsed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, to determine the landscape of the tumor microenvironment in relapsed HCC, as well as a comparison with primary HCC. We discovered that relapsed lesions have a unique immune composition as compared to the primary tumor, with a lower abundance of Tregs, a higher ratio of dendritic cells (DCs), and more infiltrated CD8+ than CD4+ T cells. In addition, we found that CD8+ T cells in the primary and relapsed tumor have the same transition path, but were in different states, CD8+ T cells from relapsed tumor showing an innate lymphoid cell (ILC)-like state, with a high naÃ¯ve signal and low cytotoxic and exhausted signals. Further analysis also indicates that the abundance of distinct DC subtypes is associated with good prognosis in both primary and relapsed HCC. Also, FCN1+ monocytes are associated with poor prognosis only in relapsed HCC and not in primary HCC. Differential analysis between primary and relapsed tumor cells in gene expression level and interactions with other cells also reveals potential different immune evasion and tumor survival strategies in relapsed and primary HCC. Together these results provide a compressive understanding of the ecosystem in primary and relapsed HCC tumors, which could be used to guide future immune therapy strategies.",307
