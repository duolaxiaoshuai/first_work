289,Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations,"The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is critical for metabolic and immune functions. However, little is known about the cells that make up the human liver and its immune microenvironment. Here we report a map of the cellular landscape of the human liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. We provide the transcriptional profiles of 8444 parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells obtained from the fractionation of fresh hepatic tissue from five human livers. Using gene expression patterns, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical examinations, we identify 20 discrete cell populations of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, B cells, conventional and non-conventional T cells, NK-like cells, and distinct intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage populations. Together, our study presents a comprehensive view of the human liver at single-cell resolution that outlines the characteristics of resident cells in the liver, and in particular provides a map of the human hepatic immune microenvironment.",immunology,liver_paper,,,GSE115469,1
290,A single cell atlas of the human liver tumor microenvironment,"Malignant cell growth is fueled by interactions between tumor cells and the stromal cells composing the tumor microenvironment. The human liver is a major site of tumors and metastases, but molecular identities and intercellular interactions of different cell types have not been resolved in these pathologies. Here, we apply single cell RNA-sequencing and spatial analysis of malignant and adjacent non-malignant liver tissues from five patients with cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastases. We find that stromal cells exhibit recurring, patient-independent expression programs, and reconstruct a ligand-receptor map that highlights recurring tumor-stroma interactions. By combining transcriptomics of laser-capture microdissected regions, we reconstruct a zonation atlas of hepatocytes in the non-malignant sites and characterize the spatial distribution of each cell type across the tumor microenvironment. Our analysis provides a resource for understanding human liver malignancies and may expose potential points of interventions.",cancer,liver_paper,,,GSE146409,1
291,Liver stromal cells restrict macrophage maturation and stromal IL-6 limits the differentiation of cirrhosis-linked macrophages,"Background & aims: Myeloid cells are key regulators of cirrhosis, a major cause of mortality worldwide. Because stromal cells can modulate the functionality of myeloid cells in vitro, targeting stromal-myeloid interactions has become an attractive potential therapeutic strategy. We aimed to investigate how human liver stromal cells impact myeloid cell properties and to understand the utility of a stromal-myeloid coculture system to study these interactions in the context of cirrhosis.Methods: Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of non-cirrhotic (n = 7) and cirrhotic (n = 5) human liver tissue were correlated to the bulk RNA-sequencing results of in vitro cocultured human CD14+ and primary liver stromal cells. Complimentary mechanistic experiments and flow cytometric analysis were performed on human liver stromal-myeloid coculture systems.Results: We found that stromal-myeloid coculture reduces the frequency CD14+ cell subsets transcriptionally similar to liver macrophages, showing that stromal cells inhibit the maturation of monocytes into macrophages. Stromal cells also influenced in vitro macrophage differentiation by skewing away from cirrhosis-linked CD9+ scar-associated macrophage-like cells and towards CD163+ Kupffer cell-like macrophages. We identify IL-6 production as a mechanism by which stromal cells limit CD9+ macrophage differentiation and find that local IL-6 levels are decreased in early-stage human liver disease compared to healthy liver tissue, suggesting a protective role for local IL-6 in the healthy liver.Conclusions: Our work reveals an unanticipated role for liver stromal cells in impeding the maturation and altering the differentiation of macrophages and should prompt investigations into the role of local IL-6 production in the pathogenesis of liver disease. These studies provide a framework for investigating macrophage-stromal interactions during cirrhosis.Lay summary: The impact of human liver stromal cells on myeloid cell maturation and differentiation in liver disease is incompletely understood. In this study, we present a mechanistic analysis using a primary in vitro human liver stromal-myeloid coculture system that is translated to liver disease using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic human liver tissue. Our work supports a role for stromal cell contact in restricting macrophage maturation and for stromal-derived IL-6 in limiting the differentiation of a cirrhotic macrophage subset.",immunology,liver_paper,,,GSE168933,1
292,COVID-19 tissue atlases reveal SARS-CoV-2 pathology and cellular targets,"COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure1-4, but little is known about its pathophysiology. Here we generated single-cell atlases of 24 lung, 16 kidney, 16 liver and 19 heart autopsy tissue samples and spatial atlases of 14 lung samples from donors who died of COVID-19. Integrated computational analysis uncovered substantial remodelling in the lung epithelial, immune and stromal compartments, with evidence of multiple paths of failed tissue regeneration, including defective alveolar type 2 differentiation and expansion of fibroblasts and putative TP63+ intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor cells. Viral RNAs were enriched in mononuclear phagocytic and endothelial lung cells, which induced specific host programs. Spatial analysis in lung distinguished inflammatory host responses in lung regions with and without viral RNA. Analysis of the other tissue atlases showed transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types in heart tissue from donors with COVID-19, and mapped cell types and genes implicated with disease severity based on COVID-19 genome-wide association studies. Our foundational dataset elucidates the biological effect of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection across the body, a key step towards new treatments.",disease,liver_paper,,,GSE171668,1
293,Temporal analyses of postnatal liver development and maturation by single-cell transcriptomics,"The postnatal development and maturation of the liver, the major metabolic organ, are inadequately understood. We have analyzed 52,834 single-cell transcriptomes and identified 31 cell types or states in mouse livers at postnatal days 1, 3, 7, 21, and 56. We observe unexpectedly high levels of hepatocyte heterogeneity in the developing liver and the progressive construction of the zonated metabolic functions from pericentral to periportal hepatocytes, which is orchestrated with the development of sinusoid endothelial, stellate, and Kupffer cells. Trajectory and gene regulatory analyses capture 36 transcription factors, including a circadian regulator, Bhlhe40, in programming liver development. Remarkably, we identified a special group of macrophages enriched at day 7 with a hybrid phenotype of macrophages and endothelial cells, which may regulate sinusoidal construction and Treg-cell function. This study provides a comprehensive atlas that covers all hepatic cell types and is instrumental for further dissection of liver development, metabolism, and disease.",developmental_biology,liver_paper,,,GSE171993,1
294,Single-cell atlas of diverse immune populations in the advanced biliary tract cancer microenvironment,"Immunotherapies have been explored in treating solid tumors, albeit with disparate clinical effects in distinct cancer types. Systematic interrogation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is vital to the prediction of immunotherapy response and the development of innovative immunotherapeutics. To comprehensively characterize the immune microenvironment in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing in unselected viable cells from 16 matched samples, and identified nineteen cell subsets from a total of 45,851 cells, in which exhausted CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) in BTC were shown to augment and communicate within the TME. Transcriptional profiles coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequences revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells retained clonal expansion and high proliferation in the TME, and some of them highly expressed the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) response gene, XBP1, indicating the role of ER stress in remodeling TME. Functional assays demonstrated that XBP1 and common immune checkpoints (PD1, TIGIT) were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells cocultured within the TME of BTC cells (GBC-SD, HCCC-9810). When treating the coculture groups with the specific inhibitor of IRE1α-XBP1 (4μ8C), the downregulation of TIGIT was observed in the treatment group. Collectively, comprehensive transcriptome profiling provides deep insights into the immune atlas in advanced BTC, which might be instrumental in exploring innovative immunotherapy strategies.",cancer,liver_paper,,,GSE201425,1
295,Portal fibroblasts with mesenchymal stem cell features form a reservoir of proliferative myofibroblasts in liver fibrosis,"Background and aims: In liver fibrosis, myofibroblasts derive from HSCs and as yet undefined mesenchymal cells. We aimed to identify portal mesenchymal progenitors of myofibroblasts.Approach and results: Portal mesenchymal cells were isolated from mouse bilio-vascular tree and analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Thereby, we uncovered the landscape of portal mesenchymal cells in homeostatic mouse liver. Trajectory analysis enabled inferring a small cell population further defined by surface markers used to isolate it. This population consisted of portal fibroblasts with mesenchymal stem cell features (PMSCs), i.e., high clonogenicity and trilineage differentiation potential, that generated proliferative myofibroblasts, contrasting with nonproliferative HSC-derived myofibroblasts (-MF). Using bulk RNA-sequencing, we built oligogene signatures of the two cell populations that remained discriminant across myofibroblastic differentiation. SLIT2, a prototypical gene of PMSC/PMSC-MF signature, mediated profibrotic and angiogenic effects of these cells, which conditioned medium promoted HSC survival and endothelial cell tubulogenesis. Using PMSC/PMSC-MF 7-gene signature and slit guidance ligand 2 fluorescent in situ hybridization, we showed that PMSCs display a perivascular portal distribution in homeostatic liver and largely expand with fibrosis progression, contributing to the myofibroblast populations that form fibrotic septa, preferentially along neovessels, in murine and human liver disorders, irrespective of etiology. We also unraveled a 6-gene expression signature of HSCs/HSC-MFs that did not vary in these disorders, consistent with their low proliferation rate.Conclusions: PMSCs form a small reservoir of expansive myofibroblasts, which, in interaction with neovessels and HSC-MFs that mainly arise through differentiation from a preexisting pool, underlie the formation of fibrotic septa in all types of liver diseases.",developmental_biology,liver_paper,,,GSE164039,1
296,Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing,"Systematic interrogation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is key to the development of immunotherapies and the prediction of their clinical responses in cancers. Here, we perform deep single-cell RNA sequencing on 5,063 single T cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, and adjacent normal tissues from six hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The transcriptional profiles of these individual cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, enable us to identify 11 T cell subsets based on their molecular and functional properties and delineate their developmental trajectory. Specific subsets such as exhausted CD8+ T cells and Tregs are preferentially enriched and potentially clonally expanded in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we identified signature genes for each subset. One of the genes, layilin, is upregulated on activated CD8+ T cells and Tregs and represses the CD8+ T cell functions in vitro. This compendium of transcriptome data provides valuable insights and a rich resource for understanding the immune landscape in cancers.","cancer,immunology",liver_paper,,,GSE98638,1
297,Cross-tissue single-cell landscape of human monocytes and macrophages in health and disease,"Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) encompass dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages (MoMac), which exhibit antimicrobial, homeostatic, and immunoregulatory functions. We integrated 178,651 MNPs from 13 tissues across 41 datasets to generate a MNP single-cell RNA compendium (MNP-VERSE), a publicly available tool to map MNPs and define conserved gene signatures of MNP populations. Next, we generated a MoMac-focused compendium that revealed an array of specialized cell subsets widely distributed across multiple tissues. Specific pathological forms were expanded in cancer and inflammation. All neoplastic tissues contained conserved tumor-associated macrophage populations. In particular, we focused on IL4I1+CD274(PD-L1)+IDO1+ macrophages, which accumulated in the tumor periphery in a T cell-dependent manner via interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and CD40/CD40L-induced maturation from IFN-primed monocytes. IL4I1_Macs exhibited immunosuppressive characteristics through tryptophan degradation and promoted the entry of regulatory T cell into tumors. This integrated analysis provides a robust online-available platform for uniform annotation and dissection of specific macrophage functions in healthy and pathological states.","cancer,immunology",liver_paper,,,GSE178209,1
298,The tumour microenvironment shapes innate lymphoid cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,"Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a typical inflammation-associated cancer. Tissue resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have been suggested to control tumour surveillance. Here, we studied how the local cytokine milieu controls ILCs in HCC.Design: We performed bulk RNA sequencing of HCC tissue as well as flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of enriched ILCs from non-tumour liver, margin and tumour core derived from 48 patients with HCC. Simultaneous measurement of protein and RNA expression at the single-cell level (AbSeq) identified precise signatures of ILC subgroups. In vitro culturing of ILCs was used to validate findings from in silico analysis. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data from large HCC cohorts allowed stratification and survival analysis based on transcriptomic signatures.Results: RNA sequencing of tumour, non-tumour and margin identified tumour-dependent gradients, which were associated with poor survival and control of ILC plasticity. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry of ILCs from HCC livers identified natural killer (NK)-like cells in the non-tumour tissue, losing their cytotoxic profile as they transitioned into tumour ILC1 and NK-like-ILC3 cells. Tumour ILC composition was mediated by cytokine gradients that directed ILC plasticity towards activated tumour ILC2s. This was liver-specific and not seen in ILCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with high ILC2/ILC1 ratio expressed interleukin-33 in the tumour that promoted ILC2 generation, which was associated with better survival.Conclusion: Our results suggest that the tumour cytokine milieu controls ILC composition and HCC outcome. Specific changes of cytokines modify ILC composition in the tumour by inducing plasticity and alter ILC function.",cancer,liver_paper,,,GSE179795,1
299,A human liver cell-based system modeling a clinical prognostic liver signature for therapeutic discovery,"Chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are life-threatening diseases with limited treatment options. The lack of clinically relevant/tractable experimental models hampers therapeutic discovery. Here, we develop a simple and robust human liver cell-based system modeling a clinical prognostic liver signature (PLS) predicting long-term liver disease progression toward HCC. Using the PLS as a readout, followed by validation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis/fibrosis/HCC animal models and patient-derived liver spheroids, we identify nizatidine, a histamine receptor H2 (HRH2) blocker, for treatment of advanced liver disease and HCC chemoprevention. Moreover, perturbation studies combined with single cell RNA-Seq analyses of patient liver tissues uncover hepatocytes and HRH2+, CLEC5Ahigh, MARCOlow liver macrophages as potential nizatidine targets. The PLS model combined with single cell RNA-Seq of patient tissues enables discovery of urgently needed targets and therapeutics for treatment of advanced liver disease and cancer prevention.",cancer,liver_paper,,,GSE173671;GSE169084;GSE136103,1
300,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the heterogeneity of liver-resident immune cells in human,"The liver plays a critical role in both immune defense and tolerance in the body. The liver-resident immune cells (LrICs) determine the immune properties, but the unique composition and heterogeneity of these cells are incompletely understood. Here, we dissect the diversity of LrICs by a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling using the unbiased single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). A total of 70, 706 of CD45+ immune cells from the paired liver perfusion, spleen and peripheral blood as references were profiled. We identified more than 30 discrete cell populations comprising 13 of T and NK cell, 7 of B cell, 4 of plasma cell, and 8 of myeloid cell subsets in human liver and donor-paired spleen and blood, and characterized their tissue distribution, gene expression and functional modules. Especially, four of CXCR6+ T and NK cell subsets were found to be present preferentially in the liver, where they manifested heterogeneity, distinct function and prominent homeostatic proliferation. We propose a universal category system of T and NK cells based on distinct chemokine receptors, confirmed subsequently by phenotype, transcriptional factors and functionality. We also identified adaptive changes by the spleen and liver-derived monocyte and macrophage populations. Finally, we give a global glimpse on B cell and plasma cell subsets in human spleen and liver. We, therefore, reveal the heterogeneity and functional diversity of LrICs in human. This study presents comprehensively the landscape of LrICs and will enable further study on their roles in various human diseases.",cell_atlas,liver_paper,,,GSE125188,1
301,Multimodal single-cell profiling of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma defines hyperactivated Tregs as a potential therapeutic target,"Background & aims: The landscape and function of the immune infiltrate of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), a rare, yet aggressive tumor of the biliary tract, remains poorly characterized, limiting development of successful immunotherapies. Herein, we aimed to define the molecular characteristics of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes with a special focus on CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs).Methods: We used high-dimensional single-cell technologies to characterize the T-cell and myeloid compartments of iCCA tissues, comparing these with their tumor-free peritumoral and circulating counterparts. We further used genomics and cellular assays to define the iCCA-specific role of a novel transcription factor, mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1), in Treg biology.Results: We found poor infiltration of putative tumor-specific CD39+ CD8+ T cells accompanied by abundant infiltration of hyperactivated CD4+ Tregs. Single-cell RNA-sequencing identified an altered network of transcription factors in iCCA-infiltrating compared to peritumoral T cells, suggesting reduced effector functions by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and enhanced immunosuppression by CD4+ Tregs. Specifically, we found that expression of MEOX1 was highly enriched in tumor-infiltrating Tregs, and demonstrated that MEOX1 overexpression is sufficient to reprogram circulating Tregs to acquire the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Accordingly, enrichment of the MEOX1-dependent gene program in Tregs was strongly associated with poor prognosis in a large cohort of patients with iCCA.Conclusions: We observed abundant infiltration of hyperactivated CD4+ Tregs in iCCA tumors along with reduced CD8+ T-cell effector functions. Interfering with hyperactivated Tregs should be explored as an approach to enhance antitumor immunity in iCCA.Lay summary: Immune cells have the potential to slow or halt the progression of tumors. However, some tumors, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, are associated with very limited immune responses (and infiltration of cancer-targeting immune cells). Herein, we show that a specific population of regulatory T cells (a type of immune cell that actually suppresses the immune response) are hyperactivated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Targeting these cells could enable cancer-targeting immune cells to act more effectively and should be looked at as a potential therapeutic approach to this aggressive cancer type.",cancer,liver_paper,,,GSE171899,1
302,Deciphering human macrophage development at single-cell resolution,"Macrophages are the first cells of the nascent immune system to emerge during embryonic development. In mice, embryonic macrophages infiltrate developing organs, where they differentiate symbiotically into tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs)1. However, our understanding of the origins and specialization of macrophages in human embryos is limited. Here we isolated CD45+ haematopoietic cells from human embryos at Carnegie stages 11 to 23 and subjected them to transcriptomic profiling by single-cell RNA sequencing, followed by functional characterization of a population of CD45+CD34+CD44+ yolk sac-derived myeloid-biased progenitors (YSMPs) by single-cell culture. We also mapped macrophage heterogeneity across multiple anatomical sites and identified diverse subsets, including various types of embryonic TRM (in the head, liver, lung and skin). We further traced the specification trajectories of TRMs from either yolk sac-derived primitive macrophages or YSMP-derived embryonic liver monocytes using both transcriptomic and developmental staging information, with a focus on microglia. Finally, we evaluated the molecular similarities between embryonic TRMs and their adult counterparts. Our data represent a comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of early macrophage development during human embryogenesis, providing a reference for future studies of the development and function of human TRMs.","immunology,developmental_biology",liver_paper,,,GSE133345;GSE137010,1
303,Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Spatiotemporal Development of Pre-thymic Lymphoid Progenitors and Thymus Organogenesis in Human Embryos,"Generation of the first T lymphocytes in the human embryo involves the emergence, migration, and thymus seeding of lymphoid progenitors together with concomitant thymus organogenesis, which is the initial step to establish the entire adaptive immune system. However, the cellular and molecular programs regulating this process remain unclear. We constructed a single-cell transcriptional landscape of human early T lymphopoiesis by using cells from multiple hemogenic and hematopoietic sites spanning embryonic and fetal stages. Among heterogenous early thymic progenitors, one subtype shared common features with a subset of lymphoid progenitors in fetal liver that are known as thymus-seeding progenitors. Unbiased bioinformatics analysis identified a distinct type of pre-thymic lymphoid progenitors in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. In parallel, we investigated thymic epithelial cell development and potential cell-cell interactions during thymus organogenesis. Together, our data provide insights into human early T lymphopoiesis that prospectively direct T lymphocyte regeneration, which might lead to development of clinical applications.",immunology,liver_paper,,,GSE133341,1
304,Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies shared differentiation paths of mouse thymic innate T cells,"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT), mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), and γδ T cells are innate T cells that acquire memory phenotype in the thymus and share similar biological characteristics. However, how their effector differentiation is developmentally regulated is still unclear. Here, we identify analogous effector subsets of these three innate T cell types in the thymus that share transcriptional profiles. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that iNKT, MAIT and γδ T cells mature via shared, branched differentiation rather than linear maturation or TCR-mediated instruction. Simultaneous TCR clonotyping analysis reveals that thymic maturation of all three types is accompanied by clonal selection and expansion. Analyses of mice deficient of TBET, GATA3 or RORγt and additional in vivo experiments corroborate the predicted differentiation paths, while human innate T cells from liver samples display similar features. Collectively, our data indicate that innate T cells share effector differentiation processes in the thymus.",immunology,liver_paper,,,E-MTAB-2582,1
305,Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Early Emergence of Liver Parenchymal and Non-parenchymal Cell Lineages,"The cellular complexity and scale of the early liver have constrained analyses examining its emergence during organogenesis. To circumvent these issues, we analyzed 45,334 single-cell transcriptomes from embryonic day (E)7.5, when endoderm progenitors are specified, to E10.5 liver, when liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell lineages emerge. Our data detail divergence of vascular and sinusoidal endothelia, including a distinct transcriptional profile for sinusoidal endothelial specification by E8.75. We characterize two distinct mesothelial cell types as well as early hepatic stellate cells and reveal distinct spatiotemporal distributions for these populations. We capture transcriptional profiles for hepatoblast specification and migration, including the emergence of a hepatomesenchymal cell type and evidence for hepatoblast collective cell migration. Further, we identify cell-cell interactions during the organization of the primitive sinusoid. This study provides a comprehensive atlas of liver lineage establishment from the endoderm and mesoderm through to the organization of the primitive sinusoid at single-cell resolution.",cell_atlas,liver_paper,,,E-MTAB-9334,1

307,Single-cell landscape of the ecosystem in early-relapse hepatocellular  carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high relapse and low 5-year survival rates.  Single-cell profiling in relapsed HCC may aid in the design of effective  anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. We profiled the transcriptomes  of ∼17,000 cells from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC cases. Early-relapse  tumors have reduced levels of regulatory T cells, increased dendritic cells  (DCs), and increased infiltrated CD8+ T cells, compared with primary tumors, in  two independent cohorts. Remarkably, CD8+ T cells in recurrent tumors  overexpressed KLRB1 (CD161) and displayed an innate-like low cytotoxic state,  with low clonal expansion, unlike the classical exhausted state observed in  primary HCC. The enrichment of these cells was associated with a worse  prognosis. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed  potential immune evasion mechanisms in recurrent tumor cells that dampen DC  antigen presentation and recruit innate-like CD8+ T cells. Our comprehensive  picture of the HCC ecosystem provides deeper insights into immune evasion  mechanisms associated with tumor relapse.",cancer,liver_paper,,,CNP0000650,1
